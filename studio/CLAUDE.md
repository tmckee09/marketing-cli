# mktg-studio

> Build the visual studio layer for the mktg marketing CLI. The studio is a local-first Next.js dashboard **driven by /cmo running in the user's Claude Code session**. /cmo invokes studio HTTP endpoints to log activity, navigate tabs, refresh data, and fire toasts. The studio itself has no chat UI and no LLM integration  -  it's a dashboard + HTTP API. There is no Vercel AI SDK (`ai`, `@ai-sdk/react`), no in-app chat panel, and the studio never calls the Anthropic API directly.

## Driver/Dashboard Contract

- **Driver:** /cmo (Claude Code) runs in the user's terminal. It reads brand/ files, executes the 75 marketing skills, and calls the studio's HTTP API (POST `/api/activity/log`, `/api/navigate`, `/api/toast`, `/api/brand/refresh`, etc.) to keep the dashboard in sync.
- **Dashboard:** Next.js + Bun server. Subscribes to `/api/events` (SSE) for live updates. Renders primary surfaces (Pulse, Signals, Publish, Brand, Settings) + a right-hand Activity panel that shows the /cmo activity stream. Trend radar is a Signals mode; Audience summary and next actions live on Pulse.
- **Activity panel:** Replaces the old chat slot. Lists skill runs, brand writes, publishes, navigates, and toasts  -  a live log of what /cmo is doing.
- **AGPL firewall:** Never import `@postiz/*`. Raw fetch only over the network boundary.
- **Auth invisible by default:** The launcher banner does not surface the token path. Set `MKTG_STUDIO_DEBUG=1 mktg studio` to see it (cabinet-style invisible-auth pattern).

## Vision: The End Goal

**One day, someone runs `/cmo` in a fresh project and /cmo says: "Let me spin up your marketing dashboard." It launches the studio dashboard, creates native publish providers, connects Postiz when external posting is needed, reads the brand/ files, and the user sees their entire marketing operation live on screen. No setup guide. No manual config. The agent builds the marketing department AND gives you the dashboard to see it working.**

This is the visual layer for `marketing-cli`. It's what turns a CLI-only experience into a full marketing studio that anyone  -  not just developers  -  can use. Easy API key setup. One-click skill execution. Real-time brand intelligence. A live Activity panel where you watch /cmo work.

**The merge:** The studio eventually ships AS PART of the mktg ecosystem. Either:
- `mktg studio` command that launches the dashboard (preferred  -  keeps mktg as the single entry point)
- Or a companion package (`mktg-studio`) that mktg references

Either way, /cmo is the brain and the studio is the eyes. They're one system.

**What "done" really looks like:**
1. `npm i -g marketing-cli` installs mktg
2. `mktg init` bootstraps a project with brand/ files
3. `mktg studio` launches the dashboard on localhost:3000
4. Onboarding wizard asks 3-5 questions → adds API keys → creates native providers / connects Postiz
5. /cmo runs foundation skills in parallel → surfaces light up one by one
6. User sees Pulse (brand health + audience summary + what to do next), Signals (intel inbox + Trend radar), Publish (social queue), Brand, Settings, and a live Activity panel that streams what /cmo is doing in Claude Code
7. Everything persists locally. Close the laptop, reopen, everything's still there.
8. The user never needs to understand CLI commands  -  the studio IS the interface.

## API Key Onboarding (Easy Setup)

The studio MUST have a dead-simple settings/onboarding screen. When a user first opens the studio, they see a wizard  -  not an empty dashboard.

**Onboarding flow:**
```
Step 1: "What's your project?"
 → mktg init --from <url> if they have a website
 → mktg init --yes if starting fresh

Step 2: "Connect your social accounts"
 → Enter POSTIZ_API_KEY (with link to https://api.postiz.com signup)
 → Enter POSTIZ_API_BASE (defaults to https://api.postiz.com)
 → Optional: TYPEFULLY_API_KEY for X/LinkedIn threads

Step 3: "Optional integrations"
 → FIRECRAWL_API_KEY (for web scraping in landscape-scan)
 → EXA_API_KEY (for deep web research  -  most skills benefit)
 → RESEND_API_KEY (for email sequences)

Step 4: "Building your marketing brain..."
 → /cmo spawns 3 research agents in parallel:
 - mktg-brand-researcher → brand/voice-profile.md
 - mktg-audience-researcher → brand/audience.md
 - mktg-competitive-scanner → brand/competitors.md
 → Dashboard surfaces light up one by one as each completes
 → Onboarding complete → Pulse tab shows first "do this next"
```

**Settings panel (accessible anytime):**
- View/edit all API keys
- See connected providers (from postiz GET /integrations)
- See brand file health (populated, missing, stale)
- See integration status (from mktg doctor)
- Reset / re-run onboarding

**Where API keys are stored:**
- `.env.local` in the project root (standard Next.js pattern)
- Or a `.mktg-studio/config.json` for studio-specific settings
- The mktg CLI reads its own env vars (POSTIZ_API_KEY etc.) from the shell environment
- The studio's settings panel writes to .env.local AND exports to shell for mktg CLI

## Agent DX 21/21  -  The Non-Negotiable Quality Bar

mktg CLI scores 21/21 on the Agent DX Scale. The studio MUST maintain this score. Every server endpoint, every data contract, every API surface the studio exposes is evaluated against these 7 axes:

| Axis | Score 3 (what we ship) | How it applies to the studio |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Machine-Readable Output** | NDJSON streaming, JSON default in non-TTY | Every `/api/*` endpoint returns typed JSON. SSE events are structured `{type, payload}`. No prose-only responses. |
| **2. Raw Payload Input** | Full JSON payload, zero translation loss | Every POST endpoint accepts a raw JSON body that maps 1:1 to the action. No bespoke form fields that lose structure. |
| **3. Schema Introspection** | Live runtime-resolved schemas with enums + nested types | `/api/schema` endpoint that returns every route's request/response shape. An agent can self-discover the studio's API. |
| **4. Context Window Discipline** | Field masks on all reads, streaming pagination | Every GET endpoint supports `?fields=` parameter. Large lists paginate. SSE streams so agents don't poll. |
| **5. Input Hardening** | Reject traversals, control chars, double encoding. "The agent is not a trusted operator." | All user input (skill names, file paths, API keys) goes through validators. The studio's Bun server trusts NOTHING from the frontend. |
| **6. Safety Rails** | `--dry-run` for all mutations, response sanitization | Every mutating endpoint supports `?dryRun=true`. Destructive actions (reset brand, delete signals) require `?confirm=true`. |
| **7. Agent Knowledge Packaging** | Comprehensive skill library, versioned, discoverable | This CLAUDE.md IS the agent knowledge. Plus: `mktg schema`, `mktg list --routing`, and `/api/schema` for runtime discovery. |

**Why this matters for the studio:** The studio isn't just a human dashboard  -  it's also an API surface that agents consume. /cmo talks to the studio's server. Future agents will talk to the studio's API. If the server doesn't follow the same DX contract as the CLI, agent integration breaks.

**Test it:** After Phase 2, run the Agent DX Scale evaluation against the studio's `/api/*` surface. Must score 21/21 or fix before proceeding.

> "Human DX optimizes for discoverability and forgiveness. Agent DX optimizes for predictability and defense-in-depth."

## Agent-Native Principles

This project follows the same agent-native contract as mktg itself:

| Principle | What it means here |
|---|---|
| **Agent-first** | The studio is a UI for an agent (/cmo), not a replacement for one. Every "smart" action is /cmo. |
| **Predictability over discoverability** | All mktg commands return typed JSON via `--json`. Schema via `mktg schema`. No surprises. |
| **Progressive enhancement** | Works at L0 (fresh install, no brand). Gets better at L4 (full brand). Studio shows the ladder. |
| **No mocks, no fake data** | Real mktg CLI calls, real brand/ files, real SQLite writes. Tests use real I/O in temp dirs. |
| **Skills never call skills** | /cmo orchestrates. The studio talks to /cmo, /cmo routes to skills. Never skip /cmo. |
| **Local-first** | SQLite + brand/ files + SSE. Zero cloud dependency for core features. Online only for /cmo (needs Claude) and postiz API. |

## Architecture

```
┌──────────────────┐ ┌──────────────────┐ ┌──────────────────────────┐
│ Next.js 16 │────▶│ Bun.serve │────▶│ Claude Code (local) │
│ Dashboard │◀─SSE│ (local server) │ │ ├── /cmo skill │

 └─────────────┘ └─────────────────┘
```

**Execution split  -  memorize this:**
- **Needs intelligence** (skill execution, recommendations, conversation) → happens in **Claude Code** where the user runs /cmo directly. /cmo then POSTs results/activity to the studio.
- **Needs data** (status, publish, catalog, doctor, list, schema) → **mktg CLI** (--json, no LLM)  -  invoked by /cmo or by the studio server.
- **Needs display** (tab rendering, brand file content) → **SQLite queries + file reads + SSE push from /cmo**

**The studio never initiates LLM calls.** /cmo pushes state to the dashboard; the dashboard pulls state from SQLite and brand/ files.

| `mktg plan next --json` | `{task: {priority, description, skill, reason}}` | Pulse tab: "do this next" card |
| `mktg doctor --json` | `{tools: [...], catalogs: [...], integrations: [...]}` | Health checks, missing tool alerts |
| `mktg list --json` | `{skills: [...], agents: [...]}` with `--routing` for CMO metadata | Skill browser, routing table |
| `mktg catalog list --json` | `{catalogs: [{name, capabilities, configured, ...}]}` | Catalog health panel |
| `mktg catalog info postiz --json` | Full CatalogEntry + `configured: bool` + `missing_envs: [...]` | Postiz connection status |

| `mktg publish --adapter postiz --json < manifest.json` | `{campaign, adapters: [{adapter, items, published, failed}]}` | Publish tab: draft creation |
| `mktg schema <cmd> --json` | `{name, description, flags, output, examples}` | Agent self-discovery |
| `mktg brand read <file>` | Raw markdown content of the brand file | Tab rendering (audience, voice, etc.) |

**Every command returns `CommandResult<T>`:**
```typescript
type CommandResult<T> =
 | { ok: true; data: T; exitCode: 0; display?: string }
 | { ok: false; error: MktgError; exitCode: 1|2|3|4|5|6 }
```

### 2. postiz  -  social distribution (external, AGPL-firewalled)

```
Repo: github.com/gitroomhq/postiz-app (NEVER fork or clone into this repo)
License: AGPL-3.0  -  API-only. Network boundary = license boundary.
Hosted: https://api.postiz.com (Stripe-gated)
Self-host: Docker (6 containers: Postgres + Redis + Temporal + Elasticsearch + app + worker)
API base: ${POSTIZ_API_BASE}/public/v1/
Auth: Authorization: <key> (bare, NO "Bearer " prefix)
Rate limit: 30 POST /public/v1/posts per hour per org
```

**AGPL firewall rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE):**
- NEVER add `@postiz/node` to any package.json (AGPL-3.0, confirmed via `npm view`)
- NEVER fork/clone postiz source into this repo
- NEVER import postiz TypeScript types (write own interfaces)
- ALL interaction via raw fetch over the network boundary
- The mktg CLI's `postizFetch` helper at `src/core/publish/postiz/client.ts` already does this correctly (studio/lib/postiz.ts imports it)

**Endpoints the studio uses (via mktg CLI adapter or direct fetch):**

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/public/v1/integrations` | GET | List connected providers |
| `/public/v1/posts` | POST | Create draft (type: "draft" for v1) |
| `/public/v1/posts?startDate=...&endDate=...` | GET | Scheduled/published queue |
| `/public/v1/is-connected` | GET | Heartbeat |

**Full API reference:** `~/projects/mktgmono/marketing-cli/docs/integration/postiz-api-reference.md` (857 lines)

## /cmo  -  The Brain (2,400 lines of orchestration knowledge)

/cmo is the single most important skill. The studio is a visual dashboard that /cmo drives. The user talks to /cmo in their Claude Code terminal (not inside the studio). /cmo then calls the studio's HTTP API to log activity, switch tabs, refresh brand-backed queries, or show toasts. Every "run a skill" / "what should I do next" still happens in /cmo  -  the studio just reflects the state.

```
Source: ~/projects/mktgmono/marketing-cli/skills/cmo/SKILL.md (478 lines)
Installed: ~/.claude/skills/cmo/SKILL.md
Rules: ~/projects/mktgmono/marketing-cli/skills/cmo/rules/ (14 files, ~1,900 lines)
```

**What /cmo knows:**
- Routes to any of 76 skills based on user intent + brand state
- 10 named orchestration playbooks (Full Product Launch, Content Engine, Founder Voice Rebrand, Conversion Audit, Retention Recovery, Visual Identity, Video Content, Email Infrastructure, SEO Authority Build, Newsletter Launch)
- L0-L4 progressive enhancement ladder (what's possible at each brand completeness level)
- Error recovery + degraded-mode playbook (what to do when integrations fail)
- Quality gate pipeline (ai-check → editorial-first-pass → content-reviewer → seo-analyst → distribute)
- Brand file → dependent skills reverse index (what to re-run when voice-profile.md changes)
- All 16 mktg CLI commands + when to use each
- All 7 sub-agents (4 research + 3 review) + spawn protocol
- External tool ecosystem (firecrawl, ffmpeg, remotion, /ply*, gh, whisper-cli, yt-dlp, summarize, Exa MCP)

**How /cmo talks to the studio (inverted from v1 of this doc):**

/cmo runs in Claude Code. When the user chats with it, /cmo POSTs to the studio's HTTP endpoints (served by Bun on port 3001). The studio fans those writes out to connected browser tabs over SSE.

| Endpoint | Direction | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /api/activity/log` | /cmo → studio | Log a skill run, brand write, publish, etc. Appears in the Activity panel live. |
| `POST /api/navigate` | /cmo → studio | Switch the active tab + apply filters. |
| `POST /api/toast` | /cmo → studio | Fire a one-off sonner toast in the dashboard. |
| `POST /api/brand/refresh` | /cmo → studio | Invalidate brand-backed SWR caches after a brand/ file write. |
| `GET /api/events` | studio → browser | Unified SSE stream: `connected`, `activity-new`, `navigate`, `toast`, `brand-file-changed`. |

The studio never initiates a Claude Code session, and there is no in-app chat widget. If the user wants to talk to /cmo, they do it in their terminal.

## Dashboard Surfaces → Execution Model

### Surface 1: Pulse
```
ON LOAD:
 → mktg status --json → brief status / brand health
 → GET /api/plan/next (mktg plan next --json) → "do this next" card (top of Next actions; snapshot heuristics fill when task is null)
 → Read brand/audience.md if populated → audience summary
 → SELECT recent activity / opportunities → notable changes + next actions

ON REFRESH (every 15 min or manual):
 → Re-run all above
```

### Surface 2: Signals (Intel Inbox + Trend Radar)
```
ON LOAD:
 → SELECT * FROM signals ORDER BY severity DESC → signal feed
 → Read brand/landscape.md + brand/competitors.md → Trend radar
 → mktg publish --adapter <adapter> --list-integrations --json → provider context
 → GET /api/compete (mktg compete list --json) → war-room list (name, url, last change)
 → GET /api/compete/scan (mktg compete scan --json) → "Scan now" refresh of the war-room


ON "TREND RADAR":
 → Same Signals surface with mode=radar

ON "REFRESH INTEL":
 → Send to /cmo: "Run landscape-scan and competitive-intel"
 → /cmo executes skills → writes brand/landscape.md + brand/competitors.md
 → File watcher → SSE → dashboard re-renders
```

### Surface 3: Publish (Social Distribution)
```
ON LOAD:
 → mktg publish --list-adapters --json → adapter picker
 → mktg publish --native-account --json → native account
 → mktg publish --adapter mktg-native --list-integrations --json → native providers
 → mktg publish --native-list-posts --json → native queue/history
 → SELECT * FROM publish_log ORDER BY created_at DESC → publish history

ON "CREATE POST":
 → Build publish manifest JSON from form input
 → mktg publish --adapter <adapter> --json < manifest.json
 → Store result in SQLite publish_log → SSE → dashboard
```

### Surface 4: Brand (Source-of-Truth Memory)
```
ON LOAD:
 → GET /api/brand/files → all brand docs + freshness
 → GET /api/brand/read?file=<name> → selected doc content
 → Parse brand/assets.md → visual asset board

ON WRITE:
 → POST /api/brand/write or /api/brand/note
 → File watcher → SSE → dependent surfaces re-render
```

### Activity Panel (Right Sidebar)

```
ON LOAD:
 → useSWR("http://localhost:3001/api/activity?limit=50") → seed list
 → Subscribe via SSEBridge to /api/events for "activity-new" → prepend live

EVERY /cmo SIDE EFFECT:
 /cmo runs a skill in Claude Code
 → /cmo POSTs to /api/activity/log with {kind, skill, summary, filesChanged}
 → Server inserts into SQLite, broadcasts "activity-new" over SSE
 → SSEBridge (mounted in dashboard layout) pushes to useActivityLiveStore
 → ActivityPanel re-renders with the new row at the top

No chat. No LLM calls from the studio. This is a pure activity log.
```

## New Files to Create

```
server.ts  -  Bun.serve: local API server (SQLite + SSE + mktg bridge + /cmo bridge)
db/schema.sql  -  SQLite schema (above)
db/migrations/  -  schema migration files
lib/mktg.ts  -  mktg CLI bridge: spawn + parse CommandResult<T> + typed wrappers
lib/agent.ts  -  Claude Code bridge: send messages to /cmo, receive responses
lib/sse.ts  -  SSE event emitter (server) + useSSE hook (client)
lib/sqlite.ts  -  SQLite connection + typed query helpers
lib/watcher.ts  -  brand/ file watcher (Bun.watch) → SSE events
lib/postiz.ts  -  thin postiz API client (mirrors mktg's postizFetch for direct queries)
lib/jobs.ts  -  background job queue for long-running skill executions
app/(dashboard)/publish/  -  new Publish tab route
components/workspace/publish/  -  Publish tab components
components/workspace/skill-browser/  -  skill browser + execution trigger UI
```

## Build Phases

### Phase 1: Bootstrap the dashboard skeleton (2-3 days)
- Scaffold the Next.js dashboard inside `studio/`
- Strip any cloud-coupled scaffolding: convex/, agent/, middleware.ts, fly.toml, railway.json, Dockerfile.agent, sign-in/, sign-up/, deck/
- Remove package.json deps: convex, @clerk/*, @convex-dev/*
- Add: bun:sqlite, create db/schema.sql
- Create: server.ts skeleton (Bun.serve with /api/health endpoint)
- Verify: `bun dev` starts Next.js on localhost:3000 (empty dashboard)

### Phase 2: Wire Infrastructure (3-4 days)
- Build lib/mktg.ts  -  shells out to `mktg <cmd> --json`, parses CommandResult, typed wrappers
- Build lib/sqlite.ts  -  connection, query helpers, migration runner
- Build lib/watcher.ts  -  Bun.watch on brand/ → SSE events
- Build lib/sse.ts  -  server-side EventSource emitter + client useSSE hook
- Wire Pulse tab: mktg status + plan next → render cards
- Verify: change brand/voice-profile.md → Pulse tab updates in <2s

### Phase 3: Wire /cmo → studio API (3-4 days)
- Build studio HTTP endpoints /cmo calls: `POST /api/activity/log`, `POST /api/navigate`, `POST /api/toast`, `POST /api/brand/refresh`
- Build the Activity panel that replaces the old chat slot  -  seeded from `/api/activity`, streamed from `/api/events`
- Build lib/jobs.ts  -  background job queue for long-running skills (reports progress via `POST /api/activity/log`)
- Verify: running /cmo in Claude Code → studio Activity panel lights up; /cmo can switch tabs and fire toasts remotely

### Phase 4: Port primary surfaces (5-7 days)
- Pulse: brand health, audience summary, and ranked next actions
- Signals: SQLite signals, Trend radar, postiz integrations, "Collect" → /cmo
- Publish: native providers, Postiz providers, draft form, scheduled queue, history, rate limit counter
- Brand: visual editor for brand memory and assets
- Settings: local API keys, provider health, doctor output, and reset controls
- Port signal severity + spike detection from Convex to local TypeScript

### Phase 5: Skill Browser + Onboarding (2-3 days)
- Skill browser: `mktg list --json` → browse all 76 skills, one-click trigger
- Execution progress: running → result → files changed
- Onboarding: detect fresh install (mktg status → needs-setup) → wizard → mktg init → foundation skills
- First-run "wow moment": Pulse, Signals, Publish, Brand, and Settings populate as foundation skills complete

### Phase 6: Polish + Test (2-3 days)
- E2E walkthrough: fresh install → mktg init → primary surfaces populated
- Offline mode: graceful degradation when postiz/LLM unavailable
- Component tests (Vitest + Testing Library) with fixture data
- Server tests (mktg CLI JSON fixtures)
- Performance: dashboard <1s load, skill execution feedback <100ms

**Total: ~4 weeks with agent team. ~6 weeks solo.**

## Meta-Prompt for the Building Team

> Fuse two layers into a local-first marketing studio that makes a solo builder feel like they have a full marketing department on their laptop.
>
> **Dashboard layer (this repo)**: 5 workspace tabs (Pulse, Signals, Publish, Brand, Settings), Activity panel, signal severity scoring. Local-first  -  no cloud dependencies.
>
> **mktg** is the marketing brain  -  76 skills, /cmo orchestrator (2,400 lines of routing knowledge), brand memory (10 files that compound), upstream catalogs. This is the engine. Everything runs through `mktg --json` for infrastructure and /cmo for intelligence.
>
> **postiz** is the distribution layer  -  30+ social providers via REST API. AGPL-firewalled. Call it, never fork it.
>
> **The one rule:** /cmo runs in Claude Code (the user's terminal) and *drives* the studio over HTTP. The studio is a dashboard + API  -  it never opens a Claude Code session, never imports `ai`/`@ai-sdk/react`, and never has an in-app chat widget. Skills call mktg CLI.
>
> **Quality bar:** Linear-fast, information-dense. Every skill execution surfaces in the Activity panel. Every brand file change ripples through the dashboard in real time via SSE. Works offline except for postiz.
>
> **Done = Pulse, Signals, Publish, Brand, and Settings rendering + Activity panel streaming /cmo activity + /cmo can navigate/toast/log-activity from Claude Code + zero cloud dependency for data.**
