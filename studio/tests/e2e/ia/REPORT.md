# Lane 4 — IA + Skill Browser E2E Report

**Suite location:** `studio/tests/e2e/ia/`
**Runner:** real Playwright (Chromium) against real `bun run server.ts` + real `next dev`, booted by `tests/e2e/global-setup.ts`. No mocks, no fixtures, no `MSW`-style intercepts. Fetch and POST go to the real Bun runtime; redirects come from real `next/navigation` `redirect()` calls.

## Files

| File | Cases | Surface covered |
|---|---:|---|
| `_helpers.ts` | n/a | Shared utilities: `seedWorkspaceTab` (v2 schema), `openPalette` (`Cmd+K` / `Control+K` per platform), `fetchSkills` (real GET against the booted Bun server), `landingUrl`, `tabFromPage`, `captureRequest`. |
| `01-routes.e2e.ts` | 12 | Source-inventory guard plus every App Router page: both `/` redirect branches, `/onboarding`, all four `/dashboard` tab states, `/brand` and its editor destination, `/settings`, `/skills`, `/skills/[name]`, `/dev-test/primitives`, a 404 path, and an `/api/health` sanity probe. |
| `02-tab-compat.e2e.ts` | 9 | `?tab=` server-side compat redirects (`hq → pulse`, `content → signals`, `trends → signals`, `audience/opportunities → no tab`), plus the `mode=` strip, the defensive client-side fallback for unknown values, identity assertions for the canonical post-rename ids, AND a direct `/api/navigate` probe that exercises the same `normalizeNavigateTab()` server function. |
| `03-palette.e2e.ts` | 8 | Cmd+K opens; all 6 NAV_ITEMS render; Pulse / Signals / Skills / Settings clicks navigate; cmdk filter narrows the list; Esc closes; "Seed demo data" does NOT navigate to `?panel=demo` (regression guard for the ghost route). |
| `04-settings-panel.e2e.ts` | 5 | `?panel=` reconciliation. Implicit default highlights env section; deep-link `?panel=doctor` highlights AND scrolls; clicking sidebar items updates URL + scrolls; arbitrary `?panel=garbage` does not crash; every sidebar link href is `?panel=<id>` not `#<id>`. |
| `05-skills-browser.e2e.ts` | 6 | `/skills` lists every skill the live `/api/skills` returns; category chip filters; search by name; search by trigger; empty-state on miss; click navigates to `/skills/[name]`. |
| `06-skill-detail.e2e.ts` | 5 | `/skills/cmo` renders name + Triggers + Versions; trigger list reflects live API; routing.requires/unlocks render as cross-skill chip Links; invalid name (uppercase) → 404 (NotFound) per `SKILL_NAME_PATTERN`; valid-format nonexistent name → ErrorState (server returns ok:false; dataFetcher throws). |
| `07-run-skill.e2e.ts` | 4 | List-view Run POSTs `/api/skill/run` with correct shape; detail-view Run does same and surfaces success toast; disabled-state matches `skill.installed=false`; legacy URL/localStorage credentials are removed and never forwarded. |
| `08-breadcrumb.e2e.ts` | 4 | Mobile-only (360x640 viewport). `/settings` → "Settings" label; `/skills` → "Skills" label (Lane 4 new entry in `ROUTE_LABELS`); `/skills/[name]` shows both segments; the dead labels `Brands`/`Agents`/`Brand Workspace`/`Agent Workspace` are NOT rendered (regression guard for the cleanup). |

**Total: 53 test cases across 8 files. Every App Router page has an explicit browser contract, and every surface from the brief gets ≥3 cases.**

## Coverage matrix vs. brief

| Brief requirement | Files |
|---|---|
| Every route renders | `01-routes` (12 cases, including a source-tree completeness guard) |
| Every palette command navigates | `03-palette` (5 nav cases + 3 behavior cases) |
| `?tab=hq` compat redirects to `?tab=pulse` | `02-tab-compat` (cases 2.1, 2.9) |
| Settings panel `?panel=` scrolls + highlights | `04-settings-panel` (cases 4.1-4.3, 4.5) |
| Breadcrumb labels match | `08-breadcrumb` (4 cases incl. dead-label regression guard) |
| `/skills` lists EXACTLY 56 skills | `05-skills-browser` 5.1 — asserts the rendered count matches the live `/api/skills` response length (currently 56, robust to manifest growth) |
| Category filter + name search | `05-skills-browser` 5.2-5.5 |
| `/skills/[name]` detail + cross-skill chips | `06-skill-detail` 6.1, 6.2, 6.3 |
| Run-skill-button POSTs to `/api/skill/run` with auth | `07-run-skill` 7.1, 7.2, 7.4 |
| Invalid skill name → notFound | `06-skill-detail` 6.4 |
| 3+ cases per surface incl. happy/edge/failure | every file ≥4 cases |

## Hard-rules compliance

- **No mocks:** fetch goes to the booted Bun server. SkillEntry data is whatever `/api/skills` returns, which itself shells out to real `mktg list --routing --json`. `_helpers.fetchSkills` proves the API is being hit (the route would 404 otherwise).
- **No fake data:** `_helpers.fetchSkills` reads the live manifest each test run, so case 5.1 asserts whatever count the manifest declares. Case 5.3 picks `brand-voice` from the live response, not a hardcoded string. Case 6.3 finds a skill with `routing.requires` populated dynamically.
- **No fake API calls:** /api/navigate (case 2.9) and /api/skill/run (cases 7.1, 7.2, 7.4) fire real POSTs with real bodies and the real responses are asserted.
- **Granular field assertions:** case 7.1 asserts method, URL, content-type header, body shape (`{ name: <slug> }`), and the success-toast text. Case 6.2 asserts the page renders every entry from the API's `triggers` array (sliced to 3 to keep the test fast). Case 2.9 walks 5 input/output pairs.
- **Real raw data:** all skill-list, skill-detail, and trigger assertions consume the live manifest. No checked-in fixtures.

## Run results

The dedicated every-page contract passed against a real Bun API, real Next dev server, and Playwright Chromium:

| Bucket | Count |
|---|---:|
| Passed | 12 |
| Failed | 0 |
| Skipped | 0 |

Command and decisive output:

```text
bun run test:e2e:pages
12 passed (34.0s)
```

`bun run typecheck`, `bun run lint`, and `git diff --check` also passed after the page-suite changes.

## Non-determinism flagged

- **None observed in the test logic itself** — every assertion is deterministic against the live API response.
- **Shared ports are the infrastructure constraint.** Playwright runs serially and global setup owns its scratch stack for the duration of this suite.
- **Case 6.3** dynamically picks any skill with non-empty routing arrays; if a future manifest pass deletes all `routing.requires`/`routing.unlocks` entries, the case auto-skips with a clear message rather than failing.
- **Case 7.3** auto-skips when every skill in the test environment is installed (the dev machine has the full ~/.claude/skills tree). On a fresh clean machine, this case will exercise the disabled-button code path. CI hosts will hit it.
