# mktg-studio

> Build the visual studio layer for the mktg marketing CLI. The studio is a local-first Next.js dashboard powered by /cmo — the agent orchestrator with 50 marketing skills. Everything intelligent goes through /cmo. Everything infrastructure goes through the mktg CLI. The studio never calls the Anthropic API directly.

## Vision: The End Goal

**One day, someone runs `/cmo` in a fresh project and /cmo says: "Let me spin up your marketing dashboard." It launches the studio dashboard, creates native publish providers, connects Postiz when external posting is needed, reads the brand/ files, and the user sees their entire marketing operation live on screen. No setup guide. No manual config. The agent builds the marketing department AND gives you the dashboard to see it working.**

This is the visual layer for `marketing-cli`. It's what turns a CLI-only experience into a full marketing studio that anyone — not just developers — can use. Easy API key setup. One-click skill execution. Real-time brand intelligence. A live Activity panel where you watch /cmo work.

**The merge:** The studio eventually ships AS PART of the mktg ecosystem. Either:
- `mktg studio` command that launches the dashboard (preferred — keeps mktg as the single entry point)
- Or a companion package (`mktg-studio`) that mktg references

Either way, /cmo is the brain and the studio is the eyes. They're one system.

**What "done" really looks like:**
1. `npm i -g marketing-cli` installs mktg
2. `mktg init` bootstraps a project with brand/ files
3. `mktg studio` launches the dashboard on localhost:3000
4. Onboarding wizard asks 3-5 questions → adds API keys → creates native providers / connects Postiz
5. /cmo runs foundation skills in parallel → surfaces light up one by one
6. User sees Pulse (brand health + audience summary + what to do next), Signals (creative assets + draft campaigns), Publish (social queue), Brand, Settings, and the live Activity panel
7. Everything persists locally. Close the laptop, reopen, everything's still there.
8. The user never needs to understand CLI commands — the studio IS the interface.

## API Key Onboarding (Easy Setup)

The studio MUST have a dead-simple settings/onboarding screen. When a user first opens the studio, they see a wizard — not an empty dashboard.

**Onboarding flow:**
```
Step 1: "What's your project?"
 → mktg init --from <url> if they have a website
 → mktg init --yes if starting fresh

Step 2: "Connect your social accounts"
 → Enter POSTIZ_API_KEY (with link to https://api.postiz.com signup)
 → Enter POSTIZ_API_BASE (defaults to https://api.postiz.com)
 → Optional: TYPEFULLY_API_KEY for X/LinkedIn threads

Step 3: "Optional integrations"
 → FIRECRAWL_API_KEY (for web scraping in landscape-scan)
 → EXA_API_KEY (for deep web research — most skills benefit)
 → RESEND_API_KEY (for email sequences)

Step 4: "Building your marketing brain..."
 → /cmo spawns 3 research agents in parallel:
 - mktg-brand-researcher → brand/voice-profile.md
 - mktg-audience-researcher → brand/audience.md
 - mktg-competitive-scanner → brand/competitors.md
 → Dashboard surfaces light up one by one as each completes
 → Onboarding complete → Pulse tab shows first "do this next"
```

**Settings panel (accessible anytime):**
- View/edit all API keys
- See connected providers (from postiz GET /integrations)
- See brand file health (populated, missing, stale)
- See integration status (from mktg doctor)
- Reset / re-run onboarding

**Where API keys are stored:**
- `.env.local` in the project root (standard Next.js pattern)
- Or a `.mktg-studio/config.json` for studio-specific settings
- The mktg CLI reads its own env vars (POSTIZ_API_KEY etc.) from the shell environment
- The studio's settings panel writes to .env.local AND exports to shell for mktg CLI

## Agent DX 21/21 — The Non-Negotiable Quality Bar

mktg CLI scores 21/21 on the Agent DX Scale. The studio MUST maintain this score. Every server endpoint, every data contract, every API surface the studio exposes is evaluated against these 7 axes:

| Axis | Score 3 (what we ship) | How it applies to the studio |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Machine-Readable Output** | NDJSON streaming, JSON default in non-TTY | Every `/api/*` endpoint returns typed JSON. SSE events are structured `{type, payload}`. No prose-only responses. |
| **2. Raw Payload Input** | Full JSON payload, zero translation loss | Every POST endpoint accepts a raw JSON body that maps 1:1 to the action. No bespoke form fields that lose structure. |
| **3. Schema Introspection** | Live runtime-resolved schemas with enums + nested types | `/api/schema` endpoint that returns every route's request/response shape. An agent can self-discover the studio's API. |
| **4. Context Window Discipline** | Field masks on all reads, streaming pagination | Every GET endpoint supports `?fields=` parameter. Large lists paginate. SSE streams so agents don't poll. |
| **5. Input Hardening** | Reject traversals, control chars, double encoding. "The agent is not a trusted operator." | All user input (skill names, file paths, API keys) goes through validators. The studio's Bun server trusts NOTHING from the frontend. |
| **6. Safety Rails** | `--dry-run` for all mutations, response sanitization | Every mutating endpoint supports `?dryRun=true`. Destructive actions (reset brand, delete signals) require `?confirm=true`. |
| **7. Agent Knowledge Packaging** | Comprehensive skill library, versioned, discoverable | This CLAUDE.md IS the agent knowledge. Plus: `mktg schema`, `mktg list --routing`, and `/api/schema` for runtime discovery. |

**Why this matters for the studio:** The studio isn't just a human dashboard — it's also an API surface that agents consume. /cmo talks to the studio's server. Future agents will talk to the studio's API. If the server doesn't follow the same DX contract as the CLI, agent integration breaks.

**Test it:** After Phase 2, run the Agent DX Scale evaluation against the studio's `/api/*` surface. Must score 21/21 or fix before proceeding.

> "Human DX optimizes for discoverability and forgiveness. Agent DX optimizes for predictability and defense-in-depth."

## Agent-Native Principles

This project follows the same agent-native contract as mktg itself:

| Principle | What it means here |
|---|---|
| **Agent-first** | The studio is a UI for an agent (/cmo), not a replacement for one. Every "smart" action is /cmo. |
| **Predictability over discoverability** | All mktg commands return typed JSON via `--json`. Schema via `mktg schema`. No surprises. |
| **Progressive enhancement** | Works at L0 (fresh install, no brand). Gets better at L4 (full brand). Studio shows the ladder. |
| **No mocks, no fake data** | Real mktg CLI calls, real brand/ files, real SQLite writes. Tests use real I/O in temp dirs. |
| **Skills never call skills** | /cmo orchestrates. The studio talks to /cmo, /cmo routes to skills. Never skip /cmo. |
| **Local-first** | SQLite + brand/ files + SSE. Zero cloud dependency for core features. Online only for /cmo (needs Claude) and postiz API. |

## Architecture

**Execution split — memorize this:**

| `mktg plan next --json` | `{task: {priority, description, skill, reason}}` | Pulse tab: "do this next" card |
| `mktg doctor --json` | `{tools: [...], catalogs: [...], integrations: [...]}` | Health checks, missing tool alerts |
| `mktg list --json` | `{skills: [...], agents: [...]}` with `--routing` for CMO metadata | Skill browser, routing table |
| `mktg catalog list --json` | `{catalogs: [{name, capabilities, configured, ...}]}` | Catalog health panel |
| `mktg catalog info postiz --json` | Full CatalogEntry + `configured: bool` + `missing_envs: [...]` | Postiz connection status |

| `mktg brand read <file>` | Raw markdown content of the brand file | Tab rendering (audience, voice, etc.) |

**Every command returns `CommandResult<T>`:**
```typescript
type CommandResult<T> =
 | { ok: true; data: T; exitCode: 0; display?: string }
 | { ok: false; error: MktgError; exitCode: 1|2|3|4|5|6 }
```

### 2. postiz — social distribution (external, AGPL-firewalled)

```
Repo: github.com/gitroomhq/postiz-app (NEVER fork or clone into this repo)
License: AGPL-3.0 — API-only. Network boundary = license boundary.
Hosted: https://api.postiz.com (Stripe-gated)
Self-host: Docker (6 containers: Postgres + Redis + Temporal + Elasticsearch + app + worker)
API base: ${POSTIZ_API_BASE}/public/v1/
Auth: Authorization: <key> (bare, NO "Bearer " prefix)
Rate limit: 30 POST /public/v1/posts per hour per org
```

**AGPL firewall rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE):**
- NEVER add `@postiz/node` to any package.json (AGPL-3.0, confirmed via `npm view`)
- NEVER fork/clone postiz source into this repo
- NEVER import postiz TypeScript types (write own interfaces)
- ALL interaction via raw fetch over the network boundary
- The mktg CLI's `postizFetch` helper at `publish.ts:263` already does this correctly

**Endpoints the studio uses (via mktg CLI adapter or direct fetch):**

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/public/v1/integrations` | GET | List connected providers |
| `/public/v1/posts` | POST | Create draft (type: "draft" for v1) |
| `/public/v1/posts?startDate=...&endDate=...` | GET | Scheduled/published queue |
| `/public/v1/is-connected` | GET | Heartbeat |

**Full API reference:** `~/projects/mktgmono/marketing-cli/docs/integration/postiz-api-reference.md` (857 lines)

## /cmo — The Brain (2,400 lines of orchestration knowledge)

/cmo is the single most important skill. The studio is a visual frontend for /cmo. The user talks to /cmo in Claude Code; Studio reflects the work through its HTTP API, Activity panel, and primary surfaces. Every "run this skill" request goes through /cmo. Every "what should I do next?" is /cmo routing.

```
Source: ~/projects/mktgmono/marketing-cli/skills/cmo/SKILL.md (478 lines)
Installed: ~/.claude/skills/cmo/SKILL.md
Rules: ~/projects/mktgmono/marketing-cli/skills/cmo/rules/ (14 files, ~1,900 lines)
```

**What /cmo knows:**
- Routes to any of 50 skills based on user intent + brand state
- 10 named orchestration playbooks (Full Product Launch, Content Engine, Founder Voice Rebrand, Conversion Audit, Retention Recovery, Visual Identity, Video Content, Email Infrastructure, SEO Authority Build, Newsletter Launch)
- L0-L4 progressive enhancement ladder (what's possible at each brand completeness level)
- Error recovery + degraded-mode playbook (what to do when integrations fail)
- Quality gate pipeline (ai-check → editorial-first-pass → content-reviewer → seo-analyst → distribute)
- Brand file → dependent skills reverse index (what to re-run when voice-profile.md changes)
- All 16 mktg CLI commands + when to use each
- All 7 sub-agents (4 research + 3 review) + spawn protocol
- External tool ecosystem (firecrawl, ffmpeg, remotion, /ply*, gh, whisper-cli, yt-dlp, summarize, Exa MCP)

**How the studio talks to /cmo:**

The Bun server sends messages to a persistent Claude Code session with /cmo loaded. Three integration patterns (decide in Phase 3):

| Pattern | How | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A. Remote session** | Claude Code remote-control API | Cleanest, persistent state | Needs session management |
| **B. Agent tool** | Studio runs inside Claude Code, uses Agent tool for /cmo | Natural nesting | Studio coupled to Claude Code |
| **C. tmux bridge** | Send keystrokes to Claude Code in tmux pane | Battle-tested (/os uses this) | Lower-tech, fragile |

## Dashboard Surfaces → Execution Model

### Surface 1: Pulse
```
ON LOAD:
 → mktg status --json → brief status / brand health
 → mktg plan next --json → "do this next" card
 → Read brand/audience.md if populated → audience summary
 → SELECT recent activity / opportunities → notable changes + next actions

ON REFRESH (every 15 min or manual):
 → Re-run all above
```

### Surface 2: Content (Creative Library)
```
ON LOAD:
 → SELECT * FROM signals ORDER BY severity DESC → signal feed
 → Read brand/assets.md + native publish drafts → generated assets and draft campaigns
 → mktg publish --adapter <adapter> --list-integrations --json → provider context

ON "COLLECT SIGNALS" BUTTON:
 → Send to /cmo: "Collect fresh signals from X and news"
 → /cmo routes to mktg-x + Exa MCP
 → Results stored in SQLite signals table → SSE → dashboard
```

### Pulse audience summary
```
ON LOAD:
 → Read brand/audience.md → parse into persona cards
 → Read brand/voice-profile.md → voice summary
 → Read brand/positioning.md → positioning angle

ON "REFRESH AUDIENCE" BUTTON:
 → Send to /cmo: "Refresh audience research"
 → /cmo runs audience-research skill → writes brand/audience.md
 → File watcher → SSE → dashboard
```

### Pulse next actions
```
ON LOAD:
 → Send to /cmo: "Based on current brand state, what are the top 5 actions?"
 → /cmo reads mktg status + brand/ files + progressive enhancement ladder
 → /cmo responds with ranked action cards (skill name + reason + prerequisite)
 → Store in SQLite opportunities table → render as cards

This section ALWAYS goes through /cmo — it requires intelligence to rank.
```

### Surface 3: Publish (Social Distribution)
```
ON LOAD:
 → mktg publish --list-adapters --json → adapter picker
 → mktg publish --native-account --json → native account
 → mktg publish --adapter mktg-native --list-integrations --json → native providers
 → mktg publish --native-list-posts --json → native queue/history
 → SELECT * FROM publish_log ORDER BY created_at DESC → publish history

ON "CREATE DRAFT":
 → Build publish manifest JSON from form input
 → mktg publish --adapter <adapter> --json < manifest.json
 → Store result in SQLite publish_log → SSE → dashboard
```

### Activity Panel (Side Panel)
```
EVERY MEANINGFUL /cmo ACTION:
 → /cmo runs in the user's Claude Code session
 → /cmo reads brand/ files + mktg status for grounding
 → /cmo routes to skills, writes files, publishes, or recommends next actions
 → /cmo POSTs activity/navigate/toast/brand events to the Studio API
 → Activity panel and workspace surfaces update via SSE

This is how Studio reflects /cmo. The conversation still happens in Claude Code; this panel is the durable activity trail of the orchestrator with 50 skills, 10 playbooks, and 2,400 lines of routing knowledge.

## New Files to Create

```
server.ts — Bun.serve: local API server (SQLite + SSE + mktg bridge + /cmo bridge)
db/schema.sql — SQLite schema (above)
db/migrations/ — schema migration files
lib/mktg.ts — mktg CLI bridge: spawn + parse CommandResult<T> + typed wrappers
lib/agent.ts — Claude Code bridge: send messages to /cmo, receive responses
lib/sse.ts — SSE event emitter (server) + useSSE hook (client)
lib/sqlite.ts — SQLite connection + typed query helpers
lib/watcher.ts — brand/ file watcher (Bun.watch) → SSE events
lib/postiz.ts — thin postiz API client (mirrors mktg's postizFetch for direct queries)
lib/jobs.ts — background job queue for long-running skill executions
app/(dashboard)/publish/ — new Publish tab route
components/workspace/publish/ — Publish tab components
components/workspace/skill-browser/ — skill browser + execution trigger UI
```

## Build Phases

### Phase 1: Bootstrap the dashboard skeleton (2-3 days)
- Scaffold the Next.js dashboard inside `studio/`
- Strip any cloud-coupled scaffolding: convex/, agent/, middleware.ts, fly.toml, railway.json, Dockerfile.agent, sign-in/, sign-up/, deck/
- Remove package.json deps: convex, @clerk/*, @convex-dev/*
- Add: bun:sqlite, create db/schema.sql
- Create: server.ts skeleton (Bun.serve with /api/health endpoint)
- Verify: `bun dev` starts Next.js on localhost:3000 (empty dashboard)

### Phase 2: Wire Infrastructure (3-4 days)
- Build lib/mktg.ts — shells out to `mktg <cmd> --json`, parses CommandResult, typed wrappers
- Build lib/sqlite.ts — connection, query helpers, migration runner
- Build lib/watcher.ts — Bun.watch on brand/ → SSE events
- Build lib/sse.ts — server-side EventSource emitter + client useSSE hook
- Wire Pulse tab: mktg status + plan next → render cards
- Verify: change brand/voice-profile.md → Pulse tab updates in <2s

### Phase 3: Wire /cmo (3-4 days)
- Build the Studio HTTP API /cmo calls from Claude Code
- Wire Activity panel: `/api/activity/log` + `/api/events` → display
- Build lib/jobs.ts — background job queue for long-running skills
- Wire skill execution: "run landscape-scan" → /cmo → background job → SSE progress → result
- Verify: /cmo logs grounded marketing work referencing brand/ files

### Phase 4: Port primary surfaces (5-7 days)
- Pulse: brand health, audience summary, and ranked next actions
- Content: generated assets, native publish drafts, brand asset inventory
- Publish: native providers, Postiz providers, draft form, scheduled queue, history, rate limit counter
- Brand: visual editor for brand memory and assets
- Settings: local API keys, provider health, doctor output, and reset controls
- Port signal severity + spike detection from Convex to local TypeScript

### Phase 5: Skill Browser + Onboarding (2-3 days)
- Skill browser: `mktg list --json` → browse all 50 skills, one-click trigger
- Execution progress: running → result → files changed
- Onboarding: detect fresh install (mktg status → needs-setup) → wizard → mktg init → foundation skills
- First-run "wow moment": Pulse, Signals, Publish, Brand, and Settings populate as foundation skills complete

### Phase 6: Polish + Test (2-3 days)
- E2E walkthrough: fresh install → mktg init → primary surfaces populated
- Offline mode: graceful degradation when postiz/LLM unavailable
- Component tests (Vitest + Testing Library) with fixture data
- Server tests (mktg CLI JSON fixtures)
- Performance: dashboard <1s load, skill execution feedback <100ms

**Total: ~4 weeks with agent team. ~6 weeks solo.**

## Meta-Prompt for the Building Team

> Fuse two layers into a local-first marketing studio that makes a solo builder feel like they have a full marketing department on their laptop.
>
> **Dashboard layer (this repo)**: 5 workspace tabs (Pulse, Signals, Publish, Brand, Settings), Activity panel, signal severity scoring. Local-first — no cloud dependencies.
>
> **mktg** is the marketing brain — 50 skills, /cmo orchestrator (2,400 lines of routing knowledge), brand memory (10 files that compound), upstream catalogs. This is the engine. Everything runs through `mktg --json` for infrastructure and /cmo for intelligence.
>
> **postiz** is the distribution layer — 30+ social providers via REST API. AGPL-firewalled. Call it, never fork it.
>
> **The one rule:** /cmo is the brain. The studio talks to /cmo. /cmo routes to skills. Skills call mktg CLI. The studio NEVER calls Anthropic directly.
>
> **Quality bar:** Linear-fast, information-dense. Every skill execution visible. Every brand file change ripples through the dashboard in real time. Works offline except /cmo + postiz.
>
> **Done = Pulse, Signals, Publish, Brand, Settings, Activity, and any of 50 skills triggerable from UI + zero cloud dependency for data.**
