# Sub-Agent Orchestration

/cmo spawns specialized sub-agents for parallel research and independent review. Agents never call agents — /cmo is the only orchestrator. This file documents when and how to invoke each of the 7 agents in `agents-manifest.json`.

**Canonical rule:** research agents spawn on first-run foundation building (3 in parallel). Review agents spawn on-demand after content lands.

## The 7 Agents

### Research agents (parallel, spawned on FIRST RUN or on-demand)

| Agent | Writes | Reads | Skill methodology it follows |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mktg-brand-researcher` | `brand/voice-profile.md` | project README, website, existing content | `brand-voice` SKILL.md |
| `mktg-audience-researcher` | `brand/audience.md` | project context, market space | `audience-research` SKILL.md |
| `mktg-competitive-scanner` | `brand/competitors.md` | project context, known competitors | `competitive-intel` SKILL.md |
| `mktg-backlink-prospector` | `.seo/backlink-targets.json` (project path, not brand/) | `brand/competitors.md`, `positioning.md`, `audience.md` | `off-page-seo` SKILL.md |

### Review agents (on-demand, post-content)

| Agent | Purpose | Invoke after | Scores (doesn't write) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mktg-content-reviewer` | Voice-profile consistency gate | any content draft (DRC, SEO, email, social, newsletter, lead-magnet) | Reads `brand/voice-profile.md` |
| `mktg-seo-analyst` | Keyword-plan adherence gate | any SEO asset (seo-content, landing page, competitor-alternatives, ai-seo output, every page batch from a `seo-machine` phase) | Reads `brand/keyword-plan.md` |
| `mktg-strategy-reviewer` | Decision-quality and commercial-logic gate | high-stakes growth, pricing, launch, retention, positioning, channel-allocation, or executive strategy | Reads available strategy evidence; never writes or rewrites |

## First-Run Spawn Protocol (the 3 research agents in parallel)

On `/cmo` FIRST RUN — brand files are templates, no real data — spawn **all three research agents in a single message** (one message with 3 Agent tool calls) for maximum parallelism. Foundation research is the biggest time sink; parallelizing saves 10+ minutes.

**Message pattern:**

```
<Agent tool call 1>
  subagent_type: mktg-brand-researcher
  description: Extract brand voice
  prompt: [project name] + [URL if provided] + [what the project does]
         + "Write brand/voice-profile.md. Follow the brand-voice SKILL
            methodology. Do not ask questions — research, analyze, write."

<Agent tool call 2>
  subagent_type: mktg-audience-researcher
  description: Build audience profile
  prompt: [project name] + [market space] + [problem it solves]
         + "Write brand/audience.md. Follow the audience-research SKILL
            methodology. Spawn sub-searches via Exa as needed."

<Agent tool call 3>
  subagent_type: mktg-competitive-scanner
  description: Scan competitors
  prompt: [project name] + [market space] + [known competitors if any]
         + "Write brand/competitors.md. Follow the competitive-intel SKILL
            methodology. Use Exa for live market research."
```

**Critical**: send all 3 tool calls in ONE message. Sequential spawns waste 2-3× the wall-clock time.

**What /cmo does while they run:**
- Tell the user: *"Three research agents are running in parallel — brand-voice, audience, competitors. ETA 5-10 minutes. I'll stitch the outputs when they land."*
- Don't start other skills. Wait for all 3.
- When they all return, read the 3 brand files, share what you learned, route to `positioning-angles` (which needs all 3 inputs).

**Fallback (no agents installed):** if `mktg doctor` shows agents missing, load the 3 foundation skills sequentially instead — `brand-voice`, then `audience-research`, then `competitive-intel`. Slower but identical artifact shape.

## On-Demand Research Invocation

### `mktg-backlink-prospector` — parallel backlink target research

**When /cmo invokes it:**
- The user invokes `off-page-seo` skill AND `brand/competitors.md` has 3+ competitors → spawn the prospector to fan-out research per competitor in parallel.
- `seo-machine` reaches an off-page phase in its roadmap → spawn alongside the phase execution.
- The user asks "where should I get linked from?", "find backlink targets", or "outreach prospects".

**Spawn pattern:**

```
<Agent tool call>
  subagent_type: mktg-backlink-prospector
  description: Backlink target research
  prompt: [list of top 3-7 competitor names from brand/competitors.md]
         + "Read brand/competitors.md + positioning.md + audience.md.
            Run Recipe F from off-page-seo SKILL.md per competitor.
            Classify referring domains into directories / listicles / guest-posts.
            Write to .seo/backlink-targets.json. Return a structured summary."
```

**What /cmo does with the result:**
- Read the structured summary (top 3 priority targets, total counts per bucket).
- Surface to the user; ask whether to chain into `direct-response-copy` (cold-email mode) for the first batch of outreach.
- Don't auto-write outreach emails — that's a separate user decision.

---

## On-Demand Review Invocation

### `mktg-content-reviewer` — voice consistency gate

**When /cmo invokes it:**
- After `direct-response-copy` produces landing page, sales copy, cold email.
- After `seo-content` produces an article.
- After `email-sequences` drafts a sequence (review the full flow together).
- After `content-atomizer` produces multi-platform posts (one review pass over the batch).
- After `newsletter` drafts an issue.
- After `social-campaign` Phase 3 (this agent IS the voice gate of that phase).
- After **each phase** of a `seo-machine` run — review the page batch as one set (consistent hero structure, voice, CTA across the N pages).

**Spawn pattern:**

```
<Agent tool call>
  subagent_type: mktg-content-reviewer
  description: Voice consistency review
  prompt: [file paths to review] + "Read brand/voice-profile.md. Score this
         content against the voice profile. Return structured feedback —
         what matches the voice, what drifts, specific rewrite recommendations.
         Do not rewrite; report only."
```

**What /cmo does with the result:**
- If score ≥ threshold (PASS) → present to user for approval, move on.
- If score < threshold (FAIL) → go back to the content skill with the specific rewrite recommendations. Don't ship drifted content.

### `mktg-seo-analyst` — keyword adherence gate

**When /cmo invokes it:**
- After `seo-content` produces an article.
- After `competitor-alternatives` produces a comparison page.
- After `ai-seo` produces an AI-search-optimized asset.
- After `direct-response-copy` produces a landing page (if SEO is a goal).
- After **each phase** of a `seo-machine` run — score the whole page batch (alternatives, compare, use-case, or playbook set) before merging the phase commit. Spawn alongside `mktg-content-reviewer` in one message.

**Spawn pattern:**

```
<Agent tool call>
  subagent_type: mktg-seo-analyst
  description: Keyword adherence audit
  prompt: [file path] + "Read brand/keyword-plan.md + brand/audience.md +
         brand/competitors.md. Audit this asset for: primary keyword density,
         secondary keyword coverage, search intent match, on-page SEO basics
         (title, meta, heading hierarchy), AI search readiness. Return
         structured scores and specific recommendations."
```

**What /cmo does with the result:**
- Surface the score to the user.
- If specific improvements are worth making → loop back to the content skill with the recommendations.

### `mktg-strategy-reviewer` — independent strategy gate

**When /cmo invokes it:**
- After drafting high-stakes growth, pricing, launch, retention, positioning, or channel-allocation advice.
- Before presenting a strategic recommendation as decision-ready to an executive, board, or finance stakeholder.
- Not for direct, low-risk asset requests whose direction is already settled.

**Spawn pattern:**

```
<Agent tool call>
  subagent_type: mktg-strategy-reviewer
  description: Independent strategy review
  prompt: [strategy draft or file path] + "Read the available positioning,
         audience, competitors, keyword-plan, landscape, and learnings files.
         Review the recommendation independently for diagnosis, relevant
         commercial coverage, growth motion, business effect, evidence versus
         assumptions, sequencing, trade-offs, and decision clarity. Return
         PASS, REVISE, or REJECT. Do not rewrite or modify files."
```

**What /cmo does with the result:**
- `PASS` → present the recommendation with its assumptions and decision conditions.
- `REVISE` → repair the identified material gaps, then review the changed decision once more.
- `REJECT` → return to diagnosis or gather the missing evidence; do not disguise uncertainty with more tactics.

## Never-Call-Other-Agents Invariant

Each of the 7 agents is **isolated** — they never spawn other agents. If a research agent needs content-reviewer's output, that's a signal the workflow is wrong. CMO is the coordinator; the agents are specialists.

**Anti-pattern to watch:** agents trying to chain work. If `mktg-brand-researcher` asks for audience data mid-run, reject — audience research is a separate agent, run in parallel, merged by CMO afterwards.

## Reference

- `AGENTS.md` at repo root — the drop-in agent contract.
- `agents-manifest.json` — agent registry with `category`, `file`, `reads`, `writes`, `references_skill`, `tier`.
- Each agent's `.md` file under `agents/research/` or `agents/review/` in the mktg repo; installed to `~/.claude/agents/` by `mktg init`.
