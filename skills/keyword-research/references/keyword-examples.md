# 6 Circles Method Detail

## Phase 2: Expand (The 6 Circles Method)

For each seed keyword, expand using 6 different lenses:

### Circle 1: What You Sell
Products, services, and solutions you offer directly.
> Example: "AI marketing automation", "marketing workflow templates", "fractional CMO services"

### Circle 2: Problems You Solve
Pain points and challenges your audience faces.
> Example: "marketing team overwhelmed", "can't measure marketing ROI", "content takes too long"

### Circle 3: Outcomes You Deliver
Results and transformations customers achieve.
> Example: "automated lead generation", "consistent content publishing", "marketing that runs itself"

### Circle 4: Your Unique Positioning
What makes you different from alternatives.
> Example: "no-code marketing", "AI-first approach", "community-driven marketing"

If ./brand/positioning.md is loaded, use the actual positioning angles here
instead of generic examples. The user's real differentiators should drive Circle 4.

### Circle 5: Adjacent Topics
Related areas where your audience spends time.
> Example: "startup growth", "indie hackers", "solopreneur tools", "productivity systems"

If ./brand/audience.md is loaded, use the audience's actual communities,
interests, and adjacent problems to populate Circle 5.

### Circle 6: Entities to Associate With
People, tools, frameworks, concepts you want to be connected to.
> Example: "Claude AI", "n8n automation", specific thought leaders, industry frameworks

### Expansion Techniques

For each seed, find variations using:

**Question patterns:**
- What is [keyword]?
- How to [keyword]?
- Why [keyword]?
- Best [keyword]?
- [keyword] vs [alternative]?
- [keyword] examples
- [keyword] for [audience]

**Modifier patterns:**
- [keyword] tools
- [keyword] templates
- [keyword] guide
- [keyword] strategy
- [keyword] 2026
- [keyword] for beginners
- [keyword] for [industry]

**Comparison patterns:**
- [keyword A] vs [keyword B]
- best [category]
- [tool] alternatives
- [tool] review

**Output:** Expanded list of 100-200 keywords from seed terms

# Pillar Validation Detail

## Phase 5: Pillar Validation (Critical Step)

**Before finalizing pillars, run these 4 checks.**

Most keyword research fails because pillars are chosen based on what the business
WANTS to talk about, not what the market ACTUALLY searches for. In v2, we use
live search data to validate.

**1. Search Volume Test**
Does this pillar have >1,000 monthly searches across its keyword cluster?

- If YES: Valid pillar
- If NO: Not a pillar. It may be a single article or should not be created at all.

v2 enhancement: Use web search to estimate volume. Check Google autocomplete
richness (more suggestions = more search interest), check whether Google shows
"About X results" for the query, and check SERP competitiveness as a proxy for
search demand.

Example failure: "Claude marketing" (zero search volume) chosen as pillar because
the product uses Claude. Market searches "AI marketing" instead.

**2. Product vs. Market Test**
Is this pillar something the MARKET searches for, or something YOU want to talk about?

| Product-Centric (Wrong) | Market-Centric (Right) |
|-------------------------|------------------------|
| "Our methodology" | "Marketing automation" |
| "[Your tool name] tutorials" | "[Category] tutorials" |
| "Why we're different" | "[Problem] solutions" |
| Features of your product | Outcomes people search for |

The market does not search for your product name (unless you are famous). They
search for solutions to their problems.

v2 enhancement: If positioning.md is loaded, cross-reference. The positioning
angle should INFORM keyword selection, not dictate it. Your angle is how you
write about market topics, not the topics themselves.

**3. Competitive Reality Test**
Can you actually win here?

Check the top 3 results for the pillar keyword (from Phase 3 SERP data):
- Mix of authority and smaller sites? Winnable with great content.
- Thin content from unknown sites? High opportunity.
- Reddit/forums in results? Huge opportunity -- no good article exists.

Do not choose pillars where you have no realistic path to page 1.

**4. Proprietary Advantage Test**
Do you have unique content, data, or expertise for this pillar?

| Advantage | Priority |
|-----------|----------|
| Proprietary data others do not have | Prioritize highly |
| Unique methodology or framework | Prioritize highly |
| Practitioner experience (done it, not read about it) | Prioritize |
| Same info everyone else has | Deprioritize |

If you have 2,589 marketing workflows and nobody else does, "marketing workflows"
should be a pillar. If you are writing about "AI marketing" with no unique angle,
you are competing on equal footing with everyone.

v2 enhancement: If positioning.md is loaded, the proprietary advantage test
automatically checks your stated differentiators against each pillar.

**Validation Output:**

For each proposed pillar, document:

```
Pillar: [Name]
Search volume test: PASS/FAIL -- [evidence from web search]
Market-centric test: PASS/FAIL -- [evidence]
Competitive test: PASS/FAIL -- [SERP evidence]
Proprietary advantage: YES/NO -- [what advantage]
VERDICT: VALID PILLAR / DEMOTE TO CLUSTER / REMOVE
```

**If a pillar fails 2+ tests, it is not a pillar.** Either demote it to a single
article within another pillar, or remove it entirely.

# Full Example

## Example: Keyword Research for "AI Marketing Consultant"

### Context Gathered

- **Business:** AI marketing consulting for startups
- **Audience:** Funded startups, 10-50 employees, no marketing hire yet
- **Goal:** Leads for consulting engagements
- **Timeline:** Mix of quick wins and authority building
- **Brand memory:** positioning.md loaded (angle: "Practitioner, not theorist"),
  audience.md loaded, competitors.md loaded (3 competitors profiled)

### Seed Keywords Generated (brand-informed)

- AI marketing consultant
- AI marketing strategy
- Marketing automation
- Startup marketing
- Fractional CMO
- AI marketing tools
- Marketing for funded startups (from audience.md)
- Practitioner marketing (from positioning.md)

### Expanded via 6 Circles (sample)

**Circle 1 (What you sell):** AI marketing consultant, AI marketing strategy,
AI marketing audit, marketing automation setup

**Circle 2 (Problems):** startup marketing overwhelm, no time for marketing,
marketing not working, can not hire marketing team

**Circle 3 (Outcomes):** automated lead generation, consistent content,
marketing ROI, scalable marketing

**Circle 4 (Positioning -- from positioning.md):** practitioner marketing,
marketing without theory, real-world marketing strategy, marketing from
someone who does it

**Circle 5 (Adjacent -- from audience.md):** startup growth strategies,
product-led growth, indie hacker marketing, Series A marketing playbook

**Circle 6 (Entities):** Claude AI marketing, n8n marketing automation,

### Web Search Findings (sample)

**Autocomplete discoveries:**
- "AI marketing consultant" → "AI marketing consultant for startups",
  "AI marketing consultant near me", "AI marketing consultant cost"

**People Also Ask:**
- "How much does an AI marketing consultant cost?"
- "Do I need a marketing team for my startup?"
- "What is fractional marketing?"
- "Can AI replace a marketing team?"

**SERP analysis:**
- "AI marketing consultant": Thin results, no definitive guide. Opportunity.
- "startup marketing strategy": Competitive but top results are 2023-dated.

## Implementation Notes for the LLM

When executing this skill, follow these rules precisely:

1. **Never skip the iteration check.** Always look for an existing
   keyword-plan.md before starting a new plan.

2. **Never skip web search when available.** The v2 differentiator is
   data-backed research. If web search tools are available, use them.
   Phase 3 is not optional -- it is what makes this skill worth paying for.

3. **Show your work.** When loading brand context, say what you loaded.
   When searching, show what you found. When analyzing SERPs, name the
   patterns. The user should feel like they are working with a senior
   content strategist, not a keyword generator.

4. **Preserve the 6 Circles Method.** This is the strategic core. Web
   search enhances it, does not replace it. Always run 6 Circles expansion
   before web search validation.

5. **Pillar validation is mandatory.** Do not skip the 4-check validation.
   With live SERP data, the validation is even more powerful -- use it.
   If a pillar fails 2+ tests, demote or remove it regardless of how
   "on-brand" it feels.

6. **Generate content briefs for top priorities.** Do not just list
   keywords. The briefs in ./campaigns/content-plan/ are what make this
   skill actionable. Every Tier 1 keyword should have a brief.

7. **Respect the brand memory protocol.** Read before write. Diff before
   overwrite. Confirm before save. Append to assets.md, never overwrite.

8. **PAA questions are gold.** People Also Ask questions are real queries
   from real people. Always capture them and map them to content outlines.
   They become H2s in your content briefs.

9. **The chain to /seo-content is the handoff.** Always offer it. The
   keyword plan is strategy. /seo-content is execution. The faster the
   user moves from plan to content, the more value they get.

10. **Write file paths correctly.** The plan saves to
    `./brand/keyword-plan.md`. Briefs save to
    `./campaigns/content-plan/{slug}.md`. The exact paths matter for
    cross-skill references.

11. **When web search is unavailable, gracefully degrade.** Fall back to
    the v1 process (6 Circles + strategic analysis). Note the limitation.
    The skill should still produce valuable output without search data --
    it just will not have SERP validation.

12. **Use brand positioning to differentiate, not to dictate topics.**
    The positioning angle tells you HOW to write about a topic, not WHAT
    topics to target. "The Anti-Agency" writes about "marketing strategy"
    (market term) with an anti-agency angle -- it does not target
    "anti-agency" as a keyword.
