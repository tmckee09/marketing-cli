  <b>One package. One install. CLI for the agent, Studio for the human. 76 skills, 7 research/review agents, brand memory that compounds.</b>
</p>

---

`marketing-cli` ships the playbook, the agents, the runtime schemas, and the `/cmo` routing rules so Claude, Codex, OpenCode, and any shell-capable agent run the same marketing system. Install once. Your project picks up where the last session left off.

## What's in this repo

One npm package, two surfaces. The CLI is the agent surface, the Studio dashboard is the human surface, and `mktg studio` launches the dashboard from inside the same install.

| Surface | What it is | Path |
|---|---|---|
| `mktg` CLI | 76 skills, 7 agents, brand memory, `/cmo` orchestration | (root) |
| Studio dashboard | Local Next.js + Bun API: pulse, signals, brand visualizer, publish queue | [`studio/`](studio/) |

`npm i -g marketing-cli` installs both. The repo uses a bun workspace because Studio is a Next.js app with its own build, but at install time it is one package, one tarball.

## The Problem

You ask your agent for marketing help. It writes generic copy and forgets your audience by tomorrow. The skills it would use aren't installed; the brand files don't exist; the agent learns this halfway through, when something fails mid-execution. Every session is the first session.

`marketing-cli` fixes that. Install once and your agent inherits 76 skills, 7 research/review agents, and a brand memory that compounds. Session 10 starts where session 9 ended. Every conversation builds on the last.

</p>

<p align="center"><sub><code>/cmo</code> reads your project state, picks the right skill, and writes the result back to <code>brand/</code>. The next session starts where the last one ended.</sub></p>

## The Ecosystem: What You Actually Install

`npm install -g marketing-cli` drops the CLI plus the skills and agents into Claude Code. `mktg init` sets up the project workspace.

### Core (always installed)

| | |
|---|---|
| **`mktg` CLI** | 24 commands, 21/21 Agent DX score, JSON-by-default |
| **76 marketing skills** | The playbook, copied to `~/.claude/skills/` |
| **7 research + review agents** | Parallel research and independent review in `~/.claude/agents/` |
| **10 brand memory files** | Persistent marketing memory in your project's `brand/` (10 templates plus `SCHEMA.md`), created by `mktg init` |
| **`/cmo` orchestrator** | The brain that routes every request to the right skill |
| **Studio dashboard** | Local Next.js + Bun API dashboard at `studio/`, launched via `mktg studio` |

### Chained-in CLIs (external tools mktg knows how to call)

Not bundled. These are external binaries the skills know how to drive. `mktg doctor` tells you what's missing and how to install it. Skills fall back when a tool isn't there.

| CLI | Role | Install |
|---|---|---|
| [`firecrawl-cli`](https://github.com/firecrawl/cli) | Web scrape, search, and crawl; clean markdown out | `npm i -g firecrawl-cli` plus `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` |
| `ffmpeg` | Video assembly, encoding, frame extraction | `brew install ffmpeg` |
| [`remotion`](https://remotion.dev) | Programmatic React video rendering | `npm i -g @remotion/cli` |
| [`playwright-cli`](https://playwright.dev) | Browser automation: demos, scrapes, CRO audits | `npm i -g @playwright/cli` |
| [`gh`](https://cli.github.com) | GitHub CLI for launches, PRs, issue intel | `brew install gh` |
| `whisper-cli` | Speech-to-text via whisper.cpp | `brew install whisper-cpp` |
| `yt-dlp` | Media download from YouTube/TikTok/podcasts | `brew install yt-dlp` |
| [`summarize`](https://github.com/steipete/summarize) | Text compression: TL;DR, digest, key points | `npm i -g @steipete/summarize` |
| Exa MCP + skills | Semantic search, company research, lead gen (`exa-search`, `company-research`, …) | `.mcp.json` + `EXA_API_KEY` |

### Best-practices skills (how to use a tool, written down)

When a chained-in CLI needs discipline (security, rate limits, efficiency patterns), mktg ships a **best-practices skill** alongside it. Reference SKILL.md files with a `rules/` subdirectory for depth.

Currently shipping: **`firecrawl`** (wraps the firecrawl CLI with `rules/install.md` and `rules/security.md`), **`summarize`** (wraps @steipete/summarize with `rules/install.md`), and **`mktg-x`** (Twitter/X auth-walled fetch with `scripts/fetch-x.sh`).

### The orchestration philosophy

mktg orchestrates; it doesn't reimplement. When a good tool already exists, we chain it in and ship a best-practices skill next to it. mktg ships marketing playbooks, not video encoders.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
npm i -g marketing-cli
```

That's it. The global npm install copies the 76 skills into `~/.claude/skills/` and the 7 agents into `~/.claude/agents/`. No second install command, no `mktg init` to remember.

Then open Claude Code in your project and run:

```
> /cmo
```

On first run, `/cmo` automatically routes to the conversational setup wizard (`/mktg-setup`) — 4 quick questions:

1. **What are we marketing?** URL, sentence, or open-source repo
2. **What posture?** aggressive launch / steady authority / founder-led / product-led growth
3. **Which distribution channels?** Typefully / Postiz / Resend / skip
4. **Studio dashboard? (beta)** auto-open or stay CLI-only

Your answers land in `brand/cmo-preferences.md` (the persistent contract `/cmo` reads on every future activation), then `/cmo` spawns 3 research agents in parallel to fill your foundation — voice, audience, competitors. ~5 minutes.

After foundation, `/cmo` reads your project's marketing state, knows what's done and what's missing, and routes to the right skill:

```
> /cmo help me market this app

Looking at your brand profile...

Your positioning is strong but you have zero distribution.
Here's what I'd do: write 3 SEO articles targeting your best
keywords, then atomize them into social posts. That gives you
a content engine.

Want to start there?
```

### Requirements

- Node.js 18+ or [Bun](https://bun.sh)
- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) (or any agent that reads `~/.claude/skills/`)

### Ambient context in 20 seconds

`mktg init` scaffolds the project, bare `mktg` shows the live home view, and `mktg setup` installs a SessionStart hook so every agent session opens already knowing your marketing state:

![mktg setup demo](setup-demo.gif)

## Agent Install Surfaces

The npm package ships the same knowledge across multiple agent runtimes:

| Agent / runtime | Path |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | Global install copies skills to `~/.claude/skills/` and agents to `~/.claude/agents/`; plugin metadata lives in `.claude-plugin/` |
| Codex | Plugin metadata in `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`; use the packaged `skills/` directory and `CONTEXT.md` as the runtime index |
| Gemini CLI | Extension metadata in `gemini-extension.json` |
| OpenCode / shell agents | Run `mktg schema --json`, `mktg list --routing --json`, and read `skills/cmo/rules/*.md` |

Agent contract:

- Use `mktg schema --json` to discover commands. Don't hardcode.
- Use `--json` for all CLI calls.
- Use `--fields` to keep context small.
- Use `--dry-run` before mutations.
- Use `/cmo` for marketing judgment and direct `mktg` commands for infrastructure.

---

## Studio: eyes for your agent

Run `mktg studio` and a local Next.js dashboard boots at `http://localhost:3000`. The Bun API runs alongside on `:3001`. Watch what your agent is doing in real time: pulse activity, the signal queue, brand state, publish history. Everything is on disk, local-first, no cloud round-trip.

The studio lives in [`studio/`](studio/) and ships inside the same `marketing-cli` tarball, so `mktg studio` works on any machine that has the CLI installed. The launcher resolves the in-repo `studio/` subfolder first, with fallbacks to a sibling checkout and a `mktg-studio` binary on PATH for local dev edge cases.

```bash
mktg studio                    # boot API + dashboard, open the browser
mktg studio --no-open          # boot but skip the browser
mktg studio --dry-run --json   # preview the launch envelope, no side effects
mktg studio --intent cmo       # boot into the CMO startup flow
```

`/cmo` uses `mktg studio --dry-run --json` to discover the dashboard URL without spawning a long-running process, then opens the real launch when the user asks for it. The CLI keeps the CLI surface; the studio keeps the visual one. Same project state, two windows on it.

---

## How It's Different

Other marketing skill repos give you a folder of markdown files. mktg is infrastructure.

| | mktg | Other skill repos |
|---|---|---|
| **Install** | `npm i -g marketing-cli && mktg init` | `git clone` then manually copy files |
| **CLI** | 24 commands, JSON output, exit codes, `--dry-run` | None |
| **Memory** | 10 brand files that compound across sessions | Stateless. Starts from scratch every time. |
| **Health checks** | `mktg doctor` with pass/warn/fail diagnostics | None |
| **Skill lifecycle** | Dependency DAG, freshness tracking, versioning | Flat directory of markdown |
| **Integration checks** | Proactive env var verification before routing | Fails mid-execution |
| **Schema introspection** | `mktg schema --json` for agent self-discovery | None |
| **Orchestrator** | `/cmo` with routing table, disambiguation, guardrails | Command menus |

---

## What the CLI adds on top of skills

Marketing skills tell an agent how to do specific work: write a landing page, run a competitive scan, atomize a thread for social. They work on their own.

The CLI adds the surrounding infrastructure. `mktg init` bootstraps a project in one command: detects what you're building, scaffolds `brand/`, installs the bundled skills directly (sub-second, always version-correct; set `MKTG_USE_AI_AGENT_SKILLS=1` to delegate to the registry installer instead), then runs doctor to verify. `mktg status --json` returns a structured snapshot of your marketing state, and that's what `/cmo` reads on every activation to know what exists, what's stale, and what to suggest next. `mktg doctor --json` runs the health checks: skills installed, brand files populated, API keys set. The agent finds out before it tries, instead of failing mid-execution. `mktg update` versions the skills so improvements ship without touching your brand memory. `mktg schema --json` exposes every command, flag, and output shape at runtime, so agents introspect rather than hardcode.

Skills know what to do. The CLI knows what's been done, what's stale, and what to do next. Together they make a feedback loop that gets sharper every session.

---

## Brand Memory

The `brand/` directory holds ten files that compound across sessions:

```
brand/
├── voice-profile.md      # How you sound
├── positioning.md        # Why you're different
├── audience.md           # Who you're talking to
├── competitors.md        # Who you're up against
├── landscape.md          # Competitive landscape snapshot
├── keyword-plan.md       # What people search for
├── creative-kit.md       # Visual identity rules
├── stack.md              # Marketing tools in use
├── assets.md             # Created assets log (append-only)
└── learnings.md          # What worked, what didn't (append-only)
```

**Session 1:** research from scratch. **Session 10:** your agent already knows your voice, audience, competitors, keyword gaps, and what's worked before.

Foundation research launches 3 agents **in parallel**: brand voice extraction, audience persona building, and competitor teardown. They write back to `brand/` at the same time, so a 10-minute setup buys you research that survives every future session.

The 3 research agents run **in parallel**. Results write back to `brand/` so every future session starts ahead.

---

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `mktg init` | Scaffold `brand/` plus install skills plus install agents |
| `mktg status` | Project marketing state snapshot |
| `mktg setup` | Install a Claude Code SessionStart hook that injects `mktg status` into every session |
| `mktg doctor` | Health checks: brand files, skills, agents, CLI tools, integrations |
| `mktg list` | Show all 76 skills with install status and metadata |
| `mktg update` | Re-install skills from latest package version |
| `mktg schema` | Introspect all commands, flags, and output shapes |
| `mktg skill` | Inspect, validate, register, analyze, and chain external skills |
| `mktg skill add` | Chain an external skill into the mktg ecosystem |
| `mktg brand` | Export, import, diff, and review brand memory |
| `mktg run` | Load a skill for agent consumption and log execution |
| `mktg context` | Brand context compiler: token-budgeted JSON artifact |
| `mktg plan` | Execution loop: prioritized task queue from project state |
| `mktg publish` | Distribution pipeline: push content to platforms |
| `mktg compete` | Competitor change monitor: detect changes, route to skills |
| `mktg dashboard` | JSON-only project snapshot (deprecated for humans — use `mktg studio`) |
| `mktg route` | Deterministic manifest-trigger routing: which skill for a request, no model needed |
| `mktg seo` | OpenSEO readiness: `status`, `link-project`, `sync-keywords`, `open` |
| `mktg catalog` | Upstream catalog registry: list, inspect, sync, status |
| `mktg transcribe` | Audio/video to transcript via whisper.cpp (YouTube, TikTok, podcasts, local files) |
| `mktg studio` | Launch the bundled Studio dashboard (Next.js + Bun API) from the in-repo `studio/` subfolder |
| `mktg verify` | Orchestrated test-suite runner across the mktgmono ecosystem |
| `mktg ship-check` | Aggregated go/no-go verdict across ecosystem surfaces |
| `mktg cmo` | Headless `/cmo` entry point with structured output for agents |
| `mktg release` | Version bump + changelog + git tag (+ optional npm/GitHub publish) |

Every command ships `--json`, `--dry-run`, and `--fields`. The live contract is `mktg schema --json`. `/cmo` keeps operator indexes in:

For the CMO startup flow, `/cmo` can run `mktg studio --open --intent cmo --session <id>`. Preview stays side-effect free with `mktg studio --dry-run --json --intent cmo --session <id>`, returning the exact dashboard URL it would open.

| Index | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`skills/cmo/rules/cli-runtime-index.md`](skills/cmo/rules/cli-runtime-index.md) | Full current CLI command surface and startup discovery sequence |
| [`skills/cmo/rules/publish-index.md`](skills/cmo/rules/publish-index.md) | Native/Postiz/Typefully/Resend/file publish routing |
| [`skills/cmo/rules/studio-api-index.md`](skills/cmo/rules/studio-api-index.md) | Studio HTTP API and current tab contract |

---

## Integration Checks

Third-party adapters (Postiz, Typefully, Resend) need API keys. The native publish backend is local-first and needs no external key. mktg checks integrations **before routing**, not mid-execution:

```bash
$ mktg doctor --json | jq '.checks[] | select(.name | startswith("integration"))'

{
  "name": "integration-TYPEFULLY_API_KEY",
  "status": "warn",
  "detail": "TYPEFULLY_API_KEY not set, needed by typefully"
}
```

`/cmo` reads this and guides setup before routing to a skill that needs the key. Missing integrations produce warnings, not errors. Every skill works at zero config.

agents-manifest.json    # Source of truth for agent metadata
```

### Design Principles

Every skill works at zero context. Brand memory enhances; it never gates. The CLI is agent-native by default: JSON output, structured errors, exit codes 0 through 6, `--dry-run`, and schema introspection. Errors carry a code, a hint, and a message that names the next step.

The system bootstraps itself. `mktg init` installs everything on any machine from the bundled skill set (registry delegation available via `MKTG_USE_AI_AGENT_SKILLS=1`). Skills are drop-in: add a `SKILL.md` and a manifest entry, no CLI changes needed.

Skills don't call other skills. They read and write files. `/cmo` orchestrates. There are no implicit chains. Foundation building spawns the 3 research agents simultaneously, not sequentially. Missing dependencies produce warnings, not blockers, so an agent always has a path forward.
