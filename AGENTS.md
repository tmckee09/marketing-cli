## Repository Landscape

`marketing-cli` is the public product source of truth. It owns the CLI, `/cmo`, skills, agents,
canonical manifests, publishing adapters, and the shipping Studio app under `studio/`.

| Repository | Role | Relationship to `marketing-cli` |
|---|---|---|
| `MoizIbnYousaf/marketing-cli` (this repo) | Canonical CLI package and bundled Studio | Make product, skill, agent, catalog, and Studio changes here. The npm tarball includes `studio/`. |
| `MoizIbnYousaf/mktg-site` | Public `marketing-cli.com` website | Its `website/` app presents the product. Its root `skills-manifest.json` is a timestamped downstream mirror, not an authoring source. |
| `MoizIbnYousaf/Ai-Agent-Skills` | Public skill registry and optional installer | Its `skills.json` points to live sources in this repo; it does not own or vendor the skills. Runtime delegation is opt-in via `MKTG_USE_AI_AGENT_SKILLS=1`. |
| `MoizIbnYousaf/mktg-studio` | Legacy standalone Studio checkout | Compatibility/dev fallback only. The current product app is this repo's `studio/`; do not implement Studio features in the standalone repo unless explicitly maintaining that fallback. |

### Source-of-truth flows

                         ├─> mktg-site/skills-manifest.json (timestamps/activity)
                         └─> Ai-Agent-Skills/skills.json (curated registry metadata)

```

- Edit a skill and the canonical manifest here first. Do not hand-edit downstream mirror fields to
  simulate propagation. Downstream publication is a distinct maintainer action after the canonical
  commit.
- `mktg-site/website` and this repo's `studio/` are different web apps: the former is the public
  marketing site, while the latter is the local authenticated product UI for a user's project.
- Studio and CLI must use the same project root so `brand/`, `marketing/`, and `.mktg/` agree. Set
  `MKTG_PROJECT_ROOT` when the target project is not the checkout root.
- External catalogs are runtime boundaries, not sibling product repos: Postiz
  (`gitroomhq/postiz-app`) is called over raw HTTP; OpenSEO (`every-app/open-seo`) is HTTP/MCP.
  Upstream-mirrored skills additionally track provenance in their own `upstream.json` files.

### External upstreams

These repositories contribute behavior or mirrored methodology but do not own the product:

| Upstream | Boundary |
|---|---|
| `gitroomhq/postiz-app` | Postiz publishing service, accessed through the raw HTTP adapter declared in `catalogs-manifest.json`. |
| `every-app/open-seo` | OpenSEO research service and skill family, accessed over HTTP/MCP. |
| `exa-labs/agent-skills` | Provenance source for Exa-backed research skills; Exa remains a BYO integration. |
| `higgsfield-ai/skills` | Provenance source for Higgsfield generation skills. |
| `kunchenguid/axi` | Source for the AXI tool-interface catalog/router methodology. |
| `remotion-dev/remotion` and `remotion-dev/skills` | Provenance sources for the Remotion mirrored skill; update only through its `upstream.json` + upgrade workflow. |

### Finding sibling repositories

The conventional layout is `.../mktgmono/{marketing-cli,mktg-site,mktg-studio}`.
Amp orbs may instead mount this checkout at `$PWD` and connected repos under `../repos/`.
Resolve paths in this order rather than assuming one machine-specific root:

1. Explicit override: `MKTG_CLI_PATH`, `MKTG_SITE_PATH`, or `AI_AGENT_SKILLS_PATH`.
2. Conventional sibling next to this checkout.
3. Orb connected-repo path under `../repos/`.

`MKTG_STUDIO_BIN` may override Studio launcher resolution for compatibility testing, but normal
development and releases must use the bundled `studio/` app.

### End-to-end local workflow

```bash
# CLI + bundled Studio (from marketing-cli)
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run build
bun run dev -- doctor --json
MKTG_PROJECT_ROOT="$PWD" bun run studio/bin/mktg-studio.ts --no-open

# Public website (from mktg-site/website)
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run dev
```

In an Amp orb, prefer `amp orb services ensure`: `.amp/services.yaml` supervises and portals both
the bundled Studio and the connected `mktg-site` checkout. The CLI itself is terminal-only; Studio
is its browser-facing app.

7 sub-agents that `/cmo` spawns for parallel research and review. Installed to `~/.claude/agents/` by `mktg init` and `mktg update`.

## Agent Registry

| Agent | Category | Writes | Reads skill | Spawned by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `mktg-brand-researcher` | research | `brand/voice-profile.md` | `brand-voice` | `/cmo` foundation |
| `mktg-audience-researcher` | research | `brand/audience.md` | `audience-research` | `/cmo` foundation |
| `mktg-competitive-scanner` | research | `brand/competitors.md` | `competitive-intel` | `/cmo` foundation |
| `mktg-content-reviewer` | review | none (scores only) | reads `brand/voice-profile.md` | on demand |
| `mktg-seo-analyst` | review | none (scores only) | reads `brand/keyword-plan.md` | on demand |
| `mktg-strategy-reviewer` | review | none (scores only) | reads strategic brand evidence | after high-stakes strategy |
| `mktg-backlink-prospector` | research | none (returns targets) | `off-page-seo` | off-page research |

## How Agents Work

1. **Registry:** `agents-manifest.json` is the source of truth for all agent metadata.
2. **Installation:** `mktg init` and `mktg update` copy agent `.md` files from the package to `~/.claude/agents/`.
3. **Spawning:** `/cmo` spawns all 3 research agents in a single message for maximum parallelism.
4. **Autonomy:** Agents do not ask questions. They research, analyze, and write.
5. **Isolation:** Agents never call other agents. `/cmo` orchestrates.

## Security Posture

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The agent is not a trusted operator.** Assume all inputs can be adversarial.

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| File writes | Constrained to `brand/`, `marketing/`, `.mktg/` via `sandboxPath()` |
| Resource IDs | Reject `..`, absolute paths, control characters |
| CLI output | Use `--json` for all calls. TTY output is for humans, JSON is the agent contract. |
| Mutations | Use `--dry-run` before any mutating operation |
| Context window | Use `--fields` to minimize payload size |

## Drop-in Skill Contract

Add a new marketing skill without touching CLI code.

### Steps

1. Create `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
2. Add an entry to `skills-manifest.json`
3. Run `mktg update` to install

### SKILL.md Requirements

| Requirement | Detail |
|---|---|
| Max length | 500 lines. Offload depth to `references/` subdirectory. |
| Frontmatter | `name` and `description` (pushy triggers that combat undertriggering) |
| On Activation | Read brand/ files with fallback behavior for missing files |
| Anti-Patterns | Include WHY each pattern is wrong, plus what to do instead |
| Progressive enhancement | Work at L0 (zero context), improve at L4 (full brand) |
| Voice file reference | Always `voice-profile.md`, never `voice.md` |
| Brand file paths | Always use `brand/` prefix in frontmatter reads |
| Frontmatter ↔ manifest | Frontmatter `reads:`/`writes:` use `brand/x.md`; `skills-manifest.json` uses bare `x.md`. Brand entries must match after prefix strip (non-brand outputs like `marketing/...` are ignored) — `bun scripts/check-brand-io.ts` prints drift, `tests/manifest-brand-io.test.ts` enforces it. |

### CORRECT vs WRONG

```yaml
# CORRECT frontmatter
---
name: seo-content
description: >-
  Create SEO-optimized content. Use when writing blog posts, articles,
  landing page copy, or any content targeting search rankings.
reads:
  - brand/voice-profile.md
  - brand/keyword-plan.md
---
```

```yaml
# WRONG: vague trigger, missing brand prefix, wrong voice file
---
name: seo-content
description: Helps with SEO content.
reads:
  - voice.md
  - keyword-plan.md
---
```

### Reference-Implementation Traceability Convention

Every pattern claim in a skill's `references/*.md` should cite an actual file path — a real repo, a real component, a real route — not a hypothetical. Pattern docs without traceability rot into vibes; agents stop trusting them after the third "see `src/components/Foo.tsx`" that doesn't exist.

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| Cite live paths | When a pattern doc says "do it like this," it should follow with `Reference: <repo>/<path/to/file.ext>` or an inline link. Paths must exist at write time. |
| Worked examples beat abstract specs | Prefer "see how `skills/seo-machine/references/patterns/alternatives.md` references its template" over a generic explanation. |
| Update on rename | If the cited path moves, update the reference doc — same commit. A broken citation in references/ is documentation debt that compounds. |
| Multi-repo OK | Citations may point at sibling repos under `~/projects/mktgmono/` (e.g. `mktg-studio/`) or external open-source repos. Use repo-relative paths for internal, full GitHub URLs for external. |

This convention is borrowed from `skills/seo-machine/`'s `references/patterns/*.md`, which cites exact `marketing_controller.rb`, `AlternativeLayout.tsx`, and route paths in the reference implementation. Pattern docs that follow this discipline feel grounded; pattern docs that don't read like consultantware.

### Long-Arc Sprint Persistence Pattern

Some skills span weeks or months — they ship in N phases, each phase produces a deliverable, and the user resumes the work across sessions (e.g. `seo-machine` ships ~30 programmatic pages over 4-8 weeks). These skills follow the **sprint-persistence pattern**: a single canonical doc in the user's project that survives session interruption, context compaction, and worktree resets.

The canonical example is `docs/seo-machine.md` from the seo-machine skill. Any new long-arc skill should adopt this shape:

| Element | Detail |
|---|---|
| Canonical doc | One markdown file at `docs/<skill-name>.md` (or path the user picks during init). Single source of truth across sessions. |
| Phase Status Tracker | Table with `# | Phase | Pattern | Status | PR/Commit` columns. Status: `pending` → `in_progress` → `completed` (or `skipped` with reason). |
| Reference data block | Stable contracts: stack info, brand facts, paths to files the skill will edit. Marked "don't modify without explicit user instruction." |
| Resume protocol | Skill detects the doc on every invocation; if present, runs in Resume mode and picks the next pending phase. User does not need to remember where they left off. |
| Same-commit tracker update | When a phase ships, the tracker row update lands in the same commit as the phase work. Reviewers see both in one diff. |
| Config sidecar | Optional `.<skill-name>/config.json` for machine-readable state (chosen stack, project ID, etc.). Per-skill subdirectory under repo root. |

Skills that should use this pattern: any sprint, multi-page generator, or recurring audit loop that the user re-enters more than 3 times. Skills that should NOT use it: one-shot generators, single-artifact skills, anything that completes in one session.

## Drop-in Agent Contract

Add a new marketing agent without touching CLI code.

### Steps

1. Create the agent `.md` file in `agents/research/` or `agents/review/`
2. Add an entry to `agents-manifest.json` with: `category`, `file`, `reads`, `writes`, `skill`, `tier`
3. Run `mktg update` to install

### Agent Rules

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| Never ask questions | Research, analyze, write. Autonomy is the default. |
| Never call other agents | `/cmo` orchestrates all agent coordination. |
| Write to `brand/` only | All output goes to the project's `brand/` directory. |
| Reference a skill | Each agent follows one skill's methodology. |

## Drop-in Catalog Contract

Add a new upstream catalog without touching CLI code. Catalogs are external OSS projects mktg builds on top of via REST API (not vendored source, not linked SDKs).

### Steps

1. Create an entry in `catalogs-manifest.json` under `catalogs.<name>` matching the `CatalogEntry` shape (see `src/types.ts`).
2. Implement whatever the `capabilities` advertise:
   - `publish_adapters[]` → add the adapter to `ADAPTERS` and `ADAPTER_ENV_VARS` in `src/commands/publish.ts`.
   - `scheduling_adapters[]` → reserved for cal.com-style catalogs; future.
   - `email_adapters[]` → reserved for listmonk-style catalogs; future.
   - `research_adapters[]` → research/data-plane catalogs (SEO metrics, SERP, backlinks). Wired via the companion skill + optional `mcp` block, not publish adapters.
   - `skills[]` → create the corresponding `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` and register in `skills-manifest.json`.
3. Run `mktg catalog list --json` to verify the entry loaded. `loadCatalogManifest` runs here and rejects adapter-name collisions (`CATALOG_COLLISION`), licenses outside the allowlist (`CATALOG_LICENSE_DENIED`), and malformed entries (`CATALOG_MANIFEST_INVALID`) as structured errors. (`mktg catalog sync` is the wrong command for this; it checks upstream version drift against GitHub releases, not manifest validity.)
4. (Optional) Run `mktg doctor --json` to verify env vars in `auth.credential_envs` are set for the new catalog.

### Catalog Entry Requirements

| Requirement | Detail |
|---|---|
| `name` | Lowercase, validated via `validateResourceId`: no `..`, no slashes, no spaces. |
| `license` | SPDX identifier. Matched against the allowlist in `src/core/catalogs.ts`. AGPL requires `transport: "http"`. |
| `version_pinned` | An upstream tag (not `main`). `mktg catalog sync` diffs this against latest. |
| `transport` | `"sdk"` ONLY if the upstream's SDK license permits linking. Otherwise `"http"` and `sdk_reference: null`. |
| `auth` | Fully declared: `style`, `base_env`, `credential_envs`, `header_format`. Skill and adapter code never hardcodes env names; it reads from the catalog entry. |
| `capabilities` | At least one non-empty capability array (`publish_adapters`, `scheduling_adapters`, `email_adapters`, `research_adapters`). A catalog with zero capabilities is rejected at load time. |
| `mcp` (optional) | `{ url_env, default_url }` for MCP-served catalogs (e.g. openseo). `default_url` must be https. `transport` stays `"http"` — MCP rides over HTTP; no new transport value. |

### Security Posture

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Catalogs are external services. All responses are untrusted input.

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| License check | `loadCatalogManifest` rejects catalogs with licenses not on the allowlist, fails loudly. |
| Adapter collision | If two catalogs declare the same `capabilities.publish_adapters[i]`, load throws a named error, which prevents silent last-write-wins in `src/commands/publish.ts`. |
| Raw-fetch mandate | AGPL catalogs MUST use `transport: "http"`. A `package.json` test asserts banned SDK packages are absent. |
| Sandbox | State files for catalogs (sent-markers, caches) live under `.mktg/publish/` or `.mktg/cache/`, sandboxed via `sandboxPath()`. |
| Credential scope | Env vars only. Catalogs never persist credentials to `brand/` or repo-tracked files. |
| Frontmatter ↔ manifest drift | For catalog-contributed skills, `tests/integration/catalog-manifest.test.ts` asserts the skill's frontmatter `env_vars` equals `catalog.auth.base_env ∪ catalog.auth.credential_envs`. |

## Adding a CLI Command

Every new command in `src/commands/` must satisfy:

| Requirement | How |
|---|---|
| Typed return | `CommandResult<T>` with typed data |
| JSON output | `--json` flag, auto via `!isTTY()` |
| Dry run | `--dry-run` for mutating operations |
| Field filtering | `--fields` with dot-notation |
| Destructive guard | `--confirm` for destructive ops |
| Error guidance | Include `fix` field in error checks |
| Schema | Add entry in `schema.ts` with `responseSchema` |
| Streaming | `--ndjson` for list-like output |

After creating the handler, register it in `src/cli.ts`.

<!-- Track E (frostbyte) — added 2026-05-04 — Upstream-Mirrored Skill Contract -->

## Upstream-Mirrored Skill Contract

Some skills (e.g. `remotion-best-practices`) mirror an external upstream repository. Their bundled SKILL.md and `rules/` content are vendored from upstream and stay in sync via a provenance manifest plus a drift-checker script. **Distinct** from chained-in CLI skills (e.g. `firecrawl`) — those shell out to a separately-installed CLI binary and have no provenance manifest.

| Pattern | Provenance file | Drift checker | mktg integration | Example |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Upstream-mirrored | `upstream.json` | `scripts/check-upstream.sh` | `mktg skill check-upstream`, `mktg skill upgrade`, `mktg doctor` | `remotion-best-practices` |
| Chained-in CLI | (none) | (n/a) | `mktg doctor` ecosystem table | `firecrawl` |

### upstream.json Schema

| Key | Type | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `version` | number | yes | Schema version (currently `1`) |
| `fetched_at` | string (ISO 8601 UTC) | yes | When the snapshot was last refreshed. `mktg doctor` warns if > 30 days. |
| `tool` | string | yes | Tool that produced the snapshot (e.g. `"/mktg-steal"`) |
| `sources` | array | yes | One or more upstream sources mirrored into this skill |
| `sources[].name` | string | yes | Logical label, e.g. `"primary"` or `"secondary"` |
| `sources[].repo` | string | yes | GitHub `owner/repo` slug |
| `sources[].branch` | string | yes | Upstream branch tracked (typically `main`) |
| `sources[].snapshot_sha` | string | yes | Upstream commit SHA at last fetch |
| `sources[].snapshot_at` | string (ISO 8601) | optional | Per-source fetch timestamp (falls back to top-level `fetched_at`) |
| `sources[].upstream_root` | string | yes | Subtree path inside the upstream repo (e.g. `"skills/remotion"`) |
| `sources[].local_root` | string | yes | Path inside this repo where the mirror lives (e.g. `"skills/remotion-best-practices"`) |
| `sources[].files` | array | yes | Manifest of mirrored files (one entry per blob) |
| `sources[].files[].local` | string | yes | Local path relative to `local_root` |
| `sources[].files[].upstream` | string | yes | Upstream path including `upstream_root` prefix |
| `sources[].files[].sha` | string | yes | Upstream blob SHA recorded at snapshot time |
| `sources[].files[].note` | string | optional | Annotation; `"adapted-frontmatter"` flags files intentionally diverged from upstream — preserved across `mktg skill upgrade` |

The canonical reference is `skills/remotion-best-practices/upstream.json` — point at it when adding a new upstream-mirrored skill.

### Drift-Check Script Contract

Every upstream-mirrored skill ships an executable `scripts/check-upstream.sh`. Invoked from the skill directory (`cwd = skills/<name>/`), it **must**:

| Behavior | Detail |
|---|---|
| Read the manifest | `../upstream.json` is the source of truth; reject if missing or invalid JSON. |
| Fetch live tree | Use `gh api repos/<repo>/git/trees/<branch>:<upstream_root>?recursive=1` per source. |
| Compute drift | Compare each manifest entry's `sha` to the live blob SHA. Items with `note: "adapted-frontmatter"` surface in `drift.modified` but DO NOT flip `in_sync` to false. |
| Emit JSON to stdout | Shape: `{ ok, in_sync, checked_at, sources: [{ name, repo, snapshot_sha, current_sha, drift: { added, modified, removed } }] }` |
| Exit codes | `0` = no real drift; `1` = drift detected (added/removed/modified-without-note); `2` = environment error (missing `gh`/`jq`, manifest missing, network failure) |

### CLI Integration

| Command | Reads | Writes | Behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mktg skill check-upstream [<name>] [--all]` | every `<skill>/upstream.json` + `scripts/check-upstream.sh` | nothing | Aggregates per-skill drift into a single envelope. Read-only. |
| `mktg skill upgrade <name> [--dry-run] [--confirm]` | `upstream.json`, gh API | local skill files; refreshes `upstream.json`; bumps `skills-manifest.json` version | Applies drift. Adapted-frontmatter files surface as `manual_merge_required` instead of auto-overwrite. Validates post-upgrade SKILL.md and rolls back on failure. Removals require `--confirm`. |
| `mktg doctor [--check-upstream]` | every `<skill>/upstream.json` | nothing | Default mode warns on `fetched_at > 30 days`. With `--check-upstream`, additionally invokes each skill's drift script for a live verdict. |

When porting a new upstream into mktg, the contract is: ship `upstream.json` + `scripts/check-upstream.sh`, and the three CLI commands above start working automatically. No CLI code changes — drop-in by design.

<!-- end Track E section -->

## 3-Way Sync (mktg-site mirror + Ai-Agent-Skills registry)

The canonical `skills-manifest.json` is the single source of truth. Two downstream surfaces stay in lockstep with it:

- `mktg-site/skills-manifest.json` — mirror with embedded `_changed_at` / `_first_seen` ISO timestamps. The website activity page reads these.
- `Ai-Agent-Skills/skills.json` — registry with curated metadata per skill (source, sourceUrl, tags, etc.).

Downstream mirror publication is maintained outside the public product package. From this repo's
perspective, edit `skills-manifest.json` as the canonical source and treat downstream publication as
a separate maintainer action.

## Local and Amp Orb Development

### Runtime

- Package manager is **Bun** (`>=1.1.0`). Put `~/.bun/bin` and `~/.local/bin` on `PATH`.
- Local CLI wrapper: `~/.local/bin/mktg` should resolve to this checkout's `dist/cli.js` (fallback `bun src/cli.ts`). Never hardcode `/workspace`; rebuild after CLI changes with `bun run build`.
- Install deps: `bun install` at repo root (hoisted linker via `bunfig.toml`). Skills/agents install via `mktg init` / `mktg update` into `~/.claude/skills` and `~/.claude/agents`.

### Services

| Surface | Command | Ports |
|---|---|---|
| CLI (dev) | `bun run dev -- <cmd> --json` or `mktg <cmd> --json` | n/a |
| Bundled Studio API + Next | `mktg studio --no-open` (or `bun run studio/bin/mktg-studio.ts --no-open`) | API `:3001`, dashboard `:3000` |
| Public website | Run `bun run dev` in `mktg-site/website` | Next dev port |

Studio auth: bearer token at `~/.mktg/.runtime/studio-token`. A normal launcher gives it only to the Bun API; the browser bootstraps an HttpOnly, same-site session cookie and never stores the bearer in JavaScript-accessible storage. Public API routes are `/api/health`, `/api/schema`, `/api/help`, and the localhost-only `/api/auth/bootstrap`. The orb-supervised service uses the server's explicit development-only auth escape hatch because the Amp portal is itself authenticated; do not use that setting for a network-exposed deployment.

### Gotchas discovered in cloud VMs

1. **Project root**: Studio must share `brand/` and `.mktg/native-publish/` with the CLI. The launcher now defaults `MKTG_PROJECT_ROOT` to the marketing-cli parent when `studio/` is a workspace member. Still override with `MKTG_PROJECT_ROOT=/path` when pointing at an external project.
2. **`mktg verify` / `mktg ship-check` suite reachability**: repository layout resolution supports the bundled `studio/`, the legacy sibling checkout, and explicit `MKTG_CLI_PATH` / `MKTG_STUDIO_BIN` overrides.
3. **Studio lint**: run `bun --cwd studio run lint`; the bundled Studio owns its ESLint flat config.
4. **Optional integrations**: Postiz / Typefully / Resend / Firecrawl / Exa are BYO. Exa is first-class via skills `exa-search`, `exa-contents`, `company-research`, `lead-generation`, `build-with-exa` + root `.mcp.json`. Set `EXA_API_KEY`; `mktg doctor` surfaces `integration-EXA_API_KEY`.
5. **Tests**: root `bun test` (CLI); studio `bun run --cwd studio test` (or `bun run test` inside `studio/`). Do **not** run bare `bun test` in `studio/` — that also picks up `tests/e2e/perf` (Lighthouse fixtures) and fails without a prior `bun run tests/e2e/perf/run-lighthouse.ts`. No mocks — real temp-dir I/O.
6. **Studio UI vs API in cloud VMs**: Bun API on `:3001` is the source of truth. The Next dashboard on `:3000` rewrites `/api/*` → Bun; that proxy can hang (`socket hang up` / HTTP 000) while direct `:3001` curls stay healthy. If the UI stays on skeletons, verify with `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $(cat ~/.mktg/.runtime/studio-token)" http://127.0.0.1:3001/api/skills` and restart via `mktg studio --no-open` with `MKTG_PROJECT_ROOT` set to the checkout root. Do not start `bun run server.ts` alone without that root — native publish and brand paths will point at the wrong `.mktg/` and `brand/` directories.

7. **`/axi`**: tool-interface orchestrator (parallel to `/cmo` for marketing). Prefer `npx -y gh-axi` / `npx -y chrome-devtools-axi` over eager MCP. See `skills/axi/SKILL.md`.
